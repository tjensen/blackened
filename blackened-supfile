# Thanks for using the Blackened IRC Client

#
# Unfortunately, because I am constantly making changes to Blackened,
# I can't make any guarantees about the stability of the source code
# you download using CVSup.  ALWAYS keep a backup of your executable
# before updating and rebuilding, so that you can quickly downgrade
# to a more stable version should a serious bug be introduced.
#
# The code SHOULD always be able to compile, as I do actually perform
# a little testing of my own before committing my changes to the
# repository.  Otherwise, you're on your own! :)
#
# Don't have CVSup?  You can get it from:
#	http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/CVSup/
# I recommend you download a precompiled binary (if one is available
# for your platform), as trying to compile it on your own may prove
# difficult, for various reasons.
#
# To download the latest source tree using the X interface, run cvsup
# as follows:
#
#      cvsup blackened-supfile
#
# If you are not running X or you simply don't want to use the cvsup
# X interface, run it as follows:
#
#      cvsup -g -L 2 blackened-supfile
#

# This is the primary site (thanks LarZ!)
*default host=cvsup.blackened.com

# Change this if you want to put the source tree in a particular
# directory.  Otherwise, CVSup just plops it into your current
# working directory.
*default prefix=.

# Here you can select what version you want to download.  The default
# of "." is to get the CURRENT source.  To get the final 1.6.2
# release sources, change it to "REL_1_6_2".
*default tag=.

# Or, to grab the latest from the 1.8-STABLE branch, use this tag:
#*default tag=REL_1_8

# The rest you probably don't want to change.
*default base=.
*default release=cvs
*default delete use-rel-suffix
