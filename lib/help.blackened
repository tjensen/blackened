!
	Usage: ![<history number>|<history match>]
	  The ! command is used to recall previous commands in your command
	  history for re-execution.  The ! command is unique in that when it
	  is used, it leaves the matching history entry in the input line for
	  re-editing.  You can specify a history entry either by its number
	  in the history list, or by a match with a given wildcard expression.
	  For example:
	    !10
	  will put entry 10 in the history list into the input line.  
	  The following:
	    !/MSG 
	  will search the history list for a line beginning with /MSG and
	  put it in the input line (an * is implied at the end of /MSG).  When
	  using ! command with a wildcard expression, subsequent uses of
	  the ! command continue their search in the history list from where 
	  they left off.  This is reset to the end of the list when a command
	  is executed that adds an entry to the history list. Also, if a
	  wildcard expression is used once, subseqent uses of ! with no
	  expression will use the previous wild card expression.  For example,
	  the following:
	    !/MSG
	    !
	  The first call returns the first match of /MSG in the history list, 
	  and the second returns the next match, and so on.  This is useful 
	  in the following key binding:
	    BIND ^R PARSE_COMMAND /!$"Search: "
	  With this, you can hit ^R and you will be prompted for a search
	  string in the history list.  If you want to then repeat the search
	  you simply have to hit ^R and hit return, since it will use
	  the previous search by default.
	  
	  Lastly, ! may be used in command aliases as well.  When it is
	  embedded in an alias it simply executes the matching history entry
	  without first putting it in the input line for re-editing.

abort
	Usage: ABORT
	  This command causes ircII to dump core.
admin
	Usage: ADMIN [<server>|<nickname>]
	  Displays the administrative details about the given server. If
	  no server is specified, the server you are connected to is
	  used. If a nickname is supplied then it gives the administrative 
	  information for that person's current server.

alias
	Usage: ALIAS [[-]<alias> [<commands>]]
	  Creates a command alias for <commands>. Commands do not need to be
	  prefixed with a command character, in fact they shouldn't!
	  If you want an alias to type something to the channel or query
	  use SEND or SAY. You can use ';' to put multiple commands in a row.
	
	  Special character sequences, usually ircII variables, are prefixed
	  with '$'.  There are certain $ sequences built in to IRCII for getting
	  such information as your nickname and current channel, plus you can
	  expand your own variables and system variables using the $ format.  
	  You can also expand functions, substituting their return values.
	  See ASSIGN for more on this.
	
	  Here are some simple alias examples:
	    ALIAS HELLO MSG $0 Hello, $0! $1-
	  This alias can be used by typing:
	    HELLO BigCheese How are you?
	  This would act as though you had typed:
	    MSG BigCheese Hello, BigCheese! How are you?
	  ALIAS with just the <alias> argument shows the current alias
	  for that word.  ALIAS with no argument shows all current
	  aliases. To remove an alias, use ALIAS -<alias>.
	
	  To use more than one command in an alias, separate them by ';'.  
	
	  When using ALIAS in a script it is frequently useful to surround
	  the contents of your alias with { }s when you want to put more than
	  one commands in an alias. E.g:
	    ALIAS loadcommon {
	      LOAD netsplit
	      LOAD troy
	    }
	  is the same as
	    ALIAS loadcommon LOAD netsplit;LOAD troy
	  but lacks the ; and it much easier to read in a script or the .ircrc file.
	
	  For more specific information about the $ uses and more examples,
	  see the specific help files listed below.

	  FUNCTIONS
alias quote
	ALIAS MODIFIER:
	  This is a special quoting modifier.  Use of this modifier tells
	  IRCII that you wish certain characters in the converted text to be
	  quoted using the \ character.  The form of this modifier is:
	    $^c<sequence>
	  where c is the character to be quoted, and <sequence> is one of the
	  special sequences.  For example, you may wish to do the following:
	    alias foo eval echo $^$*
	  and you do
	    foo This is a $Test
	  Since $ expressions are parsed first, the $^$* is the first thing
	  parsed.  The ^$ part tells IRCII to quote all $ in the resultant
	  string.  So, the $^$* is expanded just like $* and becomes:
	    This is a $Test
	  and the ^$ causes it to quote all $, which becomes:
	    This is a \$Test
	  This is then replaced in the original alias for parsing, so /foo
	  becomes:
	    eval echo This is a \$test
	  When eval goes through the line and reparses it the $ is protected 
	  by the new \, and thus the final output will be "This is a $Test".
	  If $ was not quoted, eval would try to expand any $'s into the
	  contents of the associated variable.  Eg. one$two  would try to 
	  expand the variable $two
	  The ^ modifier must be first after the initial $.  You may specify
	  more than one character to be quoted simply be adding more ^c to the
	  expression:
	    $^$^\B
	  will quote all occurences of $ and \ in the body of the last message
	  you received.
	
	  Remember, you can use both forms of modifiers, but they must be in
	  the correct order.  All ^ modifiers must be first, followed by any
	  [] modifier.  For example:
	    $^.[-10]S
	  This will right justify your server name and quote any . in the
	  server name with \.

alias special
	Special character sequences for ALIAS:
	  All special character sequences begin with a $.  In their simpliest
	  form, the following have special meaning in aliases:
	    $*   Expands to the rest of the arguments on the command line.
	    $n   Where n is a non-negative number, expands to the nth arg.
	    $n-m Where n and m are non-negative numbers, expands to the
	         nth thru mth arguments inclusive.
	    $n-  Where n is a non-negative number, expands from the nth
	         argument to the end of the argument list.
	    $-m  Where m is a non-negative number, expands from the
	         beginning of the argument list to the mth argument.
	         This is the same as $0-m.
	    $~   Expands to the last word on a line.
	    $,   Expands to the nickname of the last person who send you 
	         a /MSG
	    $.   Expands to the nickname of the last person to whom you 
	         sent a /MSG
	    $variable  Expands to the value of one of the following:
	           1) Matching ASSIGN'd variable
	           2) Matching IRCII SET variable
	           3) Matching environment variable
	           4) Nothing
	         It checks in the order shown.  Thus, if 1 doesn't match, 2 is
	         tried.  If 2 doesn't match, 3 is tried, etc.
	         See ASSIGN for more details.
	    $[number]variable  Expands the variable and shows only 'number' of
		 characters. e.g. $blue == "nonsense"  $[3]blue == "non"
		 and $[20]blue == "nonsense           "	
		 In the second case note it is left justified in the space.
	    $[-number]variable Expands as above but it is right justified when
		 the 'number'  is bigger than the number of chars in variable.
		     $[20]blue == "           nonsense"
	    $#variable  Expands to the number of words in the variable.
	    $@variable  Expands to the number of letters in the variable.
	    $"Prompt"  Will prompt you (using the text between the double 
	               quotes) for input which will be replaced in the 
	               alias. ***WARNING***  This is no longer supported.
	               use the INPUT command instead.
	    $(sub-alias)  This expands out the sub-aliases, then uses that
	         result in place of the (sub-alias) expression.  For example
	         $($0) will first expand $0... suppose it expands to S.  Then
	         it replaces that in the original text, giving you $S, which
	         is then expanded to the name of your current server.
	    $!history!  This expands to a matching entry in your command
	         history.  The text between the ! may contain wildcards.
	    $:   Expands to the nickname of the last person to join your 
	         channel
	    $;   Expands to the nickname of the last person to send a public
	         message to your channel
	    $A   Expands to the text of your AWAY message
	    $B   Expands to the body of the last MSG you sent.
	    $C   Expands to your current channel
	    $D   Expands to the nickname of the person whose sign-on was last
	         detected by the NOTIFY mechanism
	    $H   Expands to the current numeric being processed
	    $I   Expands to the name of the channel to which you were last
	         INVITED
	    $K   Expands to the current value of CMDCHAR.  Useful to have 
	         aliases work even when you change CMDCHAR.
	    $L   Expands to the current contents of the input line
	    $N   Expands to your nickname
	    $O   Expands to the value of STATUS_OPER if you are currently an operator
	    $P   Expands to "@" if you are a chanop on the current channel
	    $Q   Expands to the nickname of the person you are QUERYing.
	    $S   Expands to the name of your server
	    $T   Expands to the 'target' of your input (either a QUERY nick or
	         a current channel)
	    $U   Expands to the last thing cut from the command line. e.g. ^U to 
	         clear line will put the line in the variable $U
	    $V   Expands to the internal ircII release date
	    $W   Expands to the current working directory
	    $Z   Expands to the time of day
	    $$   Expands to $
	
	  Argument to aliases will automatically be appended to the expanded
	  alias unless you use one of the following forms in the alias:
	     $*
	     $n
	     $n-m
	     $-m
	     $n-
	     $(sub-alias)
	  If one of these forms is used in the alias arguments are not appended.
	  For example: 
	    ALIAS M /MSG
	  will be treated as:      
	    ALIAS M /MSG $*
	  However,
	    ALIAS M /MSG $0 $1-
	  will not have the arguments appended.  If you have an alias and you wish to 
	  prevent arguments from being appended, add $() to the alias.  The $() with
	  nothing between the parenthesis expands to nothing and prevents arguments
	  from being appended.
	
	  Any alias may be surrounded by {}s so that it can be imbedded within
	  another string.  For example:
	    a${N}a
	  will expand to (assuming your nickname is BigCheese):
	    aBigCheesea
	  Aliases are automatically delimited by certain characters.  For example:
	    "$N"
	  expands to:
	    "BigCheese"
alias width
	ALIAS MODIFIER:
	  This modifier is a width specifier for any of the forms of
	  alias.  This is done by placing [<width>] after the $ (and
	  after and ^c expressions).  For example:
	    $[10]C
	  This expand to your current channel, but it will truncate any
	  characters beyond 10 in the channel name.  If the channel is
	  less than 10 characters, it will be padded on the right with
	  blanks.  Specifying a negative width will justify the field on
	  the right and pad on the left with blanks.  A width of 0 is
	  treated as though no width specifier was used.  If you get real
	  tricky, you can do things like this:
	    $([$CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH]C)
	  The value of the IRCII variable CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH will be expanded
	  in the $() expression.   If CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH is 10, this will result
	  in $[10]C which will then expand as described above.
	 
	  Remember, you can use both forms of modifiers, but they must be in
	  the correct order.  All ^ modifiers must be first, followed by any
	  [] modifier.  For example:
	    $^.[-10]S
	  This will right justify your server name and quote any . in the
	  server name with \.

	  ALIAS QUOTE
assign
	Usage: ASSIGN [[-]<user-variable> [<whatever>]]
	  ASSIGN lets you create user variables which are automatically
	  expanded by ircII in aliases using the $variable-name format.
	  For example, if you had defined:
	    ASSIGN me The Big Cheese
	  Then, in an alias, $me would expand to "The Big Cheese".  These
	  are straight textual substitutions.  You can use these kind
	  of variables as counters and indexes into lists as well.  For
	  example:
	    ASSIGN index 0
	    ASSIGN index ${index+1}
	  The first line sets "index" to 0, the seconds increments index by 1.
	  Note that the second will always be expanded if used in another
	  alias (where $ are normally expanded).  If you want it to be
	  expanded if typed at the input line, you must first set
	  INPUT_ALIASES to ON.
	
	  Note: In the above example, the mathematical expression must be
	  enclosed by {}'s  otherwise the + would be treated as an alias
	  delimiter and the addition not performed. (See @ as well)
	
	  Suppose now you wanted to use index to get a single word in a list, 
	  you could do:
	    ALIAS WORD ECHO $($index)
	  Then doing:
	    WORD This is a test
	  would display the index'th word in the list.  
	  The $($index) format does the following: it parses the text
	  between the () as a sub-alias.  The "$index" is thus evaluated
	  and returns it's value.  This value is then replaced for the () 
	  expression and evaluated.  So, if you had:
	    ASSIGN index 1
	  Then, the following would be evaluated:
	    $index becomes 1 which given
	    $(1) which becomes simply $1
	  Thus the $1 argument is used.  
	  This functionality can be nested. This the following:
	    ASSIGN A Hey You!
	    ASSIGN B A
	    ASSIGN C B
	    ALIAS NESTING echo $($($C))
	  will cause NESTING to display "Hey You!"
	
	  The following format are also legal:
	    $#name	evaluates to the number of words in name
	    $@name	evaluates to the number of characters in name
	  You can use these with the mathematical expressions as well, 
	  for example:
	    ASSIGN foo Testing One Two
	    ECHO $#foo $@foo
	    ASSIGN junk ${#foo + @foo}
	  The ECHO line will display 3 15 and the variable junk have the 
	  value 18.
	
	  Additionally, values assigned to FUNCTION_RETURN are taken to be
	  the return value of a function.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	  There is a special version of this command called '@'
	  for use in aliases and scripts.  It is well suited to mathematical
	  operations.  Its use over ASSIGN is highly recommended.

autoop
	Usage: AUTOOP [-REMOVE] [<channel> [<userhost_mask>|<nickname>]]
	  Adds an entry to the auto-op list. If no mask is given, the auto-op
	  list for the given channel will be displayed. If no channel is given,
	  all auto-op lists will be displayed.
	
	  Channel * is a special case. Entries in this channel's list will
	  be opped in all channels.
	
	  If a nickname is specified rather than a user@host mask, an attempt
	  to find that nickname's userhost will be made.  If found, the output
	  will be passed through cluster() and added to the auto-op list.
	
	  The -REMOVE flag should is used to remove a userhost, clear
	  a channel list, or clear the entire auto-op list.
	
	See Also:
	  SET AUTOOP_DELAY
	  SET AUTOOP_ENABLE
away
	Usage: AWAY [<flags>] [<away message>]
	  Marks you as "away".  Whenever someone sends you a MSG or a
	  does a WHOIS on you, they automatically see whatever message
	  you set.  While you are away, all messages you receive will be
	  timestamped and you will optionally get beeped (see SET 
	  BEEP_WHEN_AWAY) for each message.  Using AWAY with no
	  parameters marks you as no longer being away.
	
	Available Flags:
	  -one  Send away message to only the server in the current window.
	  -all  (default) send away message to all servers you may be on.

	Usage: BAN [<timeout>] [<nickname>|<userhost_mask>]
	  Adds a ban affecting the given nickname or mask to the current
	  channel.
	
	  If no userhost mask or nickname is given, the list of currently
	  pending temporary bans will be displayed.
	
	  If a timeout value is entered, the ban will be removed after that
	  many number of minutes.

basics
	Irc is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network.  It allows
	people all over the internet to talk to one another in real-time.
	Each irc user has a nickname they use.  All communication with
	another user is either by nickname or by the channel that they or
	you are on.  All IRCII commands begin with a / character.
	Anything that does not begin with a / is assumed to be a message
	that is sent to everyone on your channel.  Here is a list of
	basic commands to help you get started:
	
	    /LIST		Lists all current irc channels, number of
				users, and topic.
	    /NAMES		Shows the nicknames of all users on each
				channel
	    /JOIN <channel>	Join the named channel.  All non-commands
				you type will now go to everyone on that
				channel
	    /MSG <nick> <msg>	Sends a private message to the specified
				person.  Only the specified nickname will
				see this message.
	    /NICK		Change your nickname
	    /QUIT		Exits irc.
	    /HELP <topic>	Gets help on all IRCII commands.
	    /WHO <channel>	Shows who is on a given channel,
				including nickname, user name and host,
				and realname.
	    /WHOIS <nick>	Shows the "true" indentity of someone
	
	These commands should get you started on irc.  Use the /HELP
	command to find out more about things on irc, or ask question of
	people... most would be happy to help you out.
beep
	Usage: BEEP
	  This command makes the terminal beep.

bind auto_msg
	Usage: BIND <key> AUTO_MSG
	  The AUTO_MSG function clears the input line and types:
	    /MSG <nickname>
	  The nickname is one which was used previously.
	
	  If the input line already contains text of the above format, any
	  message text is saved and appended to the new input line.
	
	  This feature obsoletes the tabkey script.
bind backspace
	Usage: BIND <key> BACKSPACE
	  The BACKSPACE function deletes the character to the left of the
	  cursor and moves the cursor one space to the left.  If the
	  cursor is at the first position in the input line, BACKSPACE
	  has no effect.
bind backward_character
	Usage: BIND <key> BACKWARD_CHARACTER
	  The BACKWARD_CHARACTER function moves the cursor one space to
	  the left.  If the cursor is at the first character in the input
	  buffer, this function has no effect.
bind backward_history
	Usage: BIND <key> BACKWARD_HISTORY
	  Replaces the contents of the input buffer with the previous
	  command in the command history buffer.  The command history
	  buffer is a circular buffer that wraps at the end.
bind backward_word
	Usage: BIND <key> BACKWARD_WORD
	  Moves the cursor to the first character of the previous word.
	  If the cursor is in the middle of a word, the cursor is moved
	  to the first character of the same word.  If the cursor is on
	  the first character of a word or on whitespace, the cursor is
	  moved to the first character of the previous word.
bind beginning_of_line
	Usage: BIND <key> BEGINNING_OF_LINE
	  Moves the cursor to the first character in the input buffer.
	  This need not be the first character visible on the screen,
	  since the input buffer wraps when the line gets too long.  This
	  is always the first characters in the input buffer.
bind
	Usage: BIND <key> <function> [<string>]
	  Binds a keystroke sequence to an IRC function.  The
	  QUOTE_CHARACTER key (by default ^Q) may be used to override any
	  key binding and have IRC insert the actual value of the key in
	  the input line.  
	  
	See Also:
	  BIND KEYS         for information on allowable [key] parameters

	  PARSEKEY
bind clear_screen
	Usage: BIND <key> CLEAR_SCREEN
	  This function will clear the display and restart a screen that 
	  has been stopped by HOLD_MODE or by the TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN
	  function.
bind command_completion
	Usage: BIND <key> COMMAND_COMPLETION
	  The COMMAND_COMPLETION function will cause IRCII to attempt to
	  complete the command you have typed in the input line.  If a
	  match is found, it is expanded to its full length in the input
	  line.  If multiple matches are found, the complete list of
	  matching commands is displayed.  If no match is found, the
	  input line is left unchanged.
bind delete_character
	Usage: BIND <key> DELETE_CHARACTER
	  Deletes the character under the cursor.  The cursor is not
	  moved by this operation.  If the cursor is at the end of the
	  input buffer, this function has no effect.
bind delete_next_word
	Usage: BIND <key> DELETE_NEXT_WORD
	  Deletes from the cursor position to the end of the next word.
	  If the cursor is in the middle of a word, all characters from
	  the cursor position to the end of the word are deleted.  If the
	  cursor is on whitespace, all following whitespace up through
	  the end of the next word is deleted.
bind delete_previous_word
	Usage: BIND <key> DELETE_PREVIOUS_WORD
	  Deletes to the beginning of the previous word.  If the cursor
	  is in the middle of a word, all characters from the left of the
	  cursor to the beginning of the word.  If the cursor is on
	  whitespace, all whitespace through to the beginning of the
	  previous word are deleted.
bind end_of_line
	Usage: BIND <key> END_OF_LINE
	  Moves the cursor to the last character of the input buffer.
bind enter_digraph
	Usage: BIND <key> ENTER_DIGRAPH
	  The ENTER_DIGRAPH function allows you to enter digraphs or
	  compose letters not normally available on your keyboard.  If
	  you have not made any changes to the internal digraph table
	  (using DIGRAPH), you could for example enter a German sharp
	  "s";  enter the key to activate the ENTER_DIGRAPH function,
	  followed by two "s".  Note that, in order to display this
	  character on your screen, your terminal must be capable of
	  doing so.  If you, for instance, have an American 7-bit ASCII
	  terminal, and have informed ircII of this (by entering the
	  command "SET TRANSLATION ASCII"), only a normal "s" will
	  displayed, eventhough it will be treated as a German sharp
	  "s" internally.
	
	  To view the available digraphs, enter the "DIGRAPH" command
	  with no arguments.  By default, ircII uses the same sequences
	  as available on Digital VT320/VT420 terminals as well as in
	  the editor Elvis.

bind erase_line
	Usage: BIND <key> ERASE_LINE
	  Erases the contents of the input buffer, leaving it very empty.
bind erase_to_beg_of_line
	Usage: BIND <key> ERASE_TO_BEG_OF_LINE
	  Erases from the cursor position to the beginning of the input line.
bind erase_to_end_of_line
	Usage: BIND <key> ERASE_TO_END_OF_LINE
	  Erases from the cursor position to the end of the input buffer.
bind examples
	Examples of the BIND function:
	
	    BIND ^X META2_CHARACTER
	  Makes control X a meta key.
	
	    BIND ^Xl parse LIST
	  Binds the meta sequence control X followed by l to perform a LIST.
	  This binding is only valid if ^X was previously bound
	  to a meta function (as was done in the first example).
	
	    BIND META1-u BACKWARD_HISTORY
	  by default, the escape key is bound to META1_CHARACTER, so this
	  binding makes the escape u key sequence show the last command
	  history entry.  Note that more than one key may be bound to
	  *any* function.
	
	    BIND ! type Bang!
	  This binds the ! (exclamation mark) to type the word "Bang!"
	  into the input line whenever it is hit.
	
	    BIND META1-[ meta2
	    BIND meta2-A BACKWARD_HISTORY
	    BIND meta2-B FORWARD_HISTORY
	    BIND meta2-D BACKWARD_CHARACTER
	    BIND meta2-C FORWARD_CHARACTER
	  This sequence would bind your arrow keys to the functions listed.
bind forward_character
	Usage: BIND <key> FORWARD_CHARACTER
	  Moves the cursor to the right one position.  If the cursor is
	  at the end of the input buffer, this function has no effect.
bind forward_history
	Usage: BIND <key> FORWARD_HISTORY
	  Replaces the contents of the input buffer with the next entry
	  in the command history buffer.  The command history buffer is
	  circular and wraps at the end.
bind forward_word
	Usage: BIND <key> FORWARD_WORD
	  Moves the cursor to the end of the next word.  If the cursor is
	  in the middle of a word, it is moved to the end of that word.
	  If the cursor is already at the end of a word or on whitespace,
	  it is moved to the end of the next word.
bind grow_window
	Usage: BIND <key> GROW_WINDOW
	  This function increases the size of the current window by one line
	  if there is room.
	
	See Also: 
	  BIND HIDE_WINDOW
	  BIND KILL_WINDOW

bind help_character
	Usage: BIND <key> HELP_CHARACTER
	  This shows help on the current input buffer without disturbing
	  the contents of the buffer.  It is as though you had typed
	  HELP followed by whatever is in the input buffer.
bind hide_window
	Usage: BIND <key> HIDE_WINDOW
	  This function hides the current window.

bind keys
	Allowable key sequences for use with the BIND function:
	  c          where c is any key (case sensitive)
	  ^c         where c is one of A thru Z or one of
	             the following quoted set '?[]\^@'
		     (^? == delete key)
	  METAn-c    where n is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and c is the same as the 
	             first form above
	  METAn-^c   where n is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and c is the same as the
	             second form above
	  mc         where m has been previously bound to META1_CHARACTER,
	             META2_CHARACTER, META3_CHARACTER, or META4_CHARACTER 
		     and c is the same as the first form above.  m may be 
		     either of the first two forms above (m or ^m).
	  m^c        where m has been previously bound to META1_CHARACTER
	             META2_CHARACTER, META3_CHARACTER, or META4_CHARACTER
	             and c is the same as the second form above.  m may be
	             either of the first two forms above (m or ^m).
bind kill_window
	Usage: BIND <key> KILL_WINDOW
	  This function kills the current window.

bind meta1_character
	Usage: BIND <key> META1_CHARACTER
	  This function switches to an "alternate" keymap.  That is,
	  after this character is hit, the next key hit can have a new
	  definition.  This is how the Escape sequences are done.  In
	  fact, the escape key's default binding is META1_CHARACTER.  For
	  example:
	    BIND ^X META1_CHARACTER
	  binds this function to ^X.  You may then bind meta key
	  sequences with either of the two following formats:
	    BIND ^X? HELP_CHARACTER
	  or
	    BIND META1-? HELP_CHARACTER
bind meta2_character
	Usage: BIND <key> META2_CHARACTER
	  This function switches to an "alternate" keymap.  That is,
	  after this character is hit, the next key hit can have a new
	  definition.  This is how the Escape sequences are done.  In
	  fact, the escape key's default binding is META1_CHARACTER.  For
	  example:
	    BIND ^X META2_CHARACTER
	  binds this function to ^X.  You may then bind meta key
	  sequences with either of the two following formats:
	    BIND ^X? HELP_CHARACTER
	  or
	    BIND META2-? HELP_CHARACTER
bind meta3_character
	Usage: BIND <key> META3_CHARACTER
	  This function switches to another "alternate" keymap.  That is,
	  after this character is hit, the next key hit can have a new
	  definition.  This is how the Escape sequences are done.  In
	  fact, the escape key's default binding is META1_CHARACTER.  For
	  example:
	    BIND meta1-[ META3_CHARACTER
	  binds this function to ^[[.  You may then bind meta key
	  sequences with either of the two following formats:
	    BIND ^[[A BACKWARD_HISTORY
	  or
	    BIND META3-A BACKWARD_HISTORY
	  Works just like the META1_CHARACTER and the META2_CHARACTER but the
	  default binding is meta1-[   which is very useful for binding arrow
	  keys and other escape sequences.
bind meta4_character
	Usage: BIND <key> META4_CHARACTER
	  The META4_CHARACTER is just like the other meta keys except that it
	  is now sticky. That is, Meta4-C-D-E-F-G invokes the
	  meta4 versions of C, D, E, F and G. This effect lasts until
	  meta4 is invoked again. Additionally, the Meta4 characters
	  ^h, SPACE, h, i, j, k, x, H, I, J, K, L and X have been
	  bound in such a way that BIND ^[ META4_CHARACTER now
	  gives a vi editing mode.
	
	  It will stay 'stuck' until it is unstuck with any key bindings that
	  happen to activate the META4_CHARACTER.
bind new_window
	Usage: BIND <key> NEW_WINDOW
	  This function creates a new window if there is room
	
	See Also: 
	  BIND GROW_WINDOW
	  BIND HIDE_WINDOW
	  BIND LIST_WINDOWS
	  BIND KILL_WINDOW
	  BIND SHRINK_WINDOW
bind next_window
	Usage: BIND <key> NEXT_WINDOW
	  Switches the "current window" to be the next window in the
	  window list.  This is the window "below" the current window on
	  the screen.  At the bottom of the screen, this will jump to the
	  top most window on the screen.
bind nothing
	Usage: BIND <key> NOTHING
	  The NOTHING function does nothing.  Effectively, it disables
	  the key it is bound to (to which it is bound for you
	  grammatical types).
bind page_down
	Usage: BIND <key> PAGE_DOWN
	  This is effectively the same as SCROLL_FOREWARD
	
	See Also: 
	  BIND PAGE_UP
	  BIND SCROLL_FORWARD
	  BIND SCROLL_BACKWARD

	  BIND SCROLL_START
bind page_up
	Usage: BIND <key> PAGE_UP
	  This effectively the same as SCROLL_BACKWARD
	
	See Also:
	  BIND PAGE_DOWN
	  BIND SCROLL_BACKWARD
	  BIND SCROLL_FORWARD

	  BIND SCROLL_START
bind parse_command
	Usage: BIND <key> PARSE_COMMAND <string>
	  The PARSE_COMMAND function cause the supplied string to be
	  executed as an ircII command (or alias). It doesn't need to be
	  prefixed by the command character. This function does not disturb
	  the contents of the input line and is not added to the command history.
	  You may also include any of the special $ sequences available in ALIAS
	  and they will be expanded before the line is parsed.  The
	  sequences that deal with command line arguments ($*, $n, $-n)
	  are expanded as though there were no command line arguments.
	
	See Also:
	  ALIAS
	  ircII programming
bind previous_window
	Usage: BIND <key> PREVIOUS_WINDOW
	  Switches the "current window" to be the previous window in the
	  window list.  This is the window "above" the current window on
	  the screen.  At the top of the screen, this will jump to the
	  bottom most window on the screen.
bind quit_irc
	Usage: BIND <key> QUIT_IRC
	  Exit irc and return to whatever excuse for a shell you're
	  using.  Sorry.  Didn't mean that.
bind quote_character
	Usage: BIND <key> QUOTE_CHARACTER
	  This function "quotes" the next key hit.  What this really
	  means is that it overrides the key binding for the next key and
	  forces it to insert itself into the input buffer.  For example,
	  if you have Control D bound to delete character, and you hit
	  the quote character (defaults to Control Q) then Control D, it
	  will insert a Control D (shows up as an inverse video D) and
	  does not delete the character.  Got it?
bind refresh_inputline
	Usage: BIND <key> REFRESH_SCREEN
	  Amazingly, this refreshes the input line, in case some other nasty
	  program has munged it up.
bind refresh_screen
	Usage: BIND <key> REFRESH_SCREEN
	  This redraws the screen, in case some other nasty program has
	  munged it up.
bind scroll_backward
	Usage: BIND <key> SCROLL_BACKWARD
	  When SCROLL is set on, this will allow you to scroll back through
	  your lastlog entries 1/2 page at a time.  The default binding for
	  this is meta1-p.  A key must be bound to SCROLL_END to exit this
	  (default meta1-e).  It is suggested that you have HOLD_MODE set on
	  or otherwise when you get out of the history all your new messages
	  will flash by.
	
	See Also:
	  BIND SCROLL_FORWARD
	  BIND SCROLL_END
	  BIND SCROLL_START
bind scroll_end
	Usage: BIND <key> SCROLL_END
	  This binding is absolutely necessary if you plan to use
	  the features found with SCROLL_BACKWARD and SCROLL_FORWARD.
	  It allows you to exit from the viewing of the lastlog.
	  It is the counterpart of SCROLL_START.  Default binding is
	  meta1-e.
	
	See Also:
	  BIND SCROLL_START
	  BIND SCROLL_FORWARD
	  BIND SCROLL_BACKWARD
bind scroll_start
	Usage: BIND <key> SCROLL_START
	  This binding allows you to go to the start of the lastlog
	  buffer immediately, rather than using SCROLL_BACKWARD
	  a heap of times.  It is the opposite of SCROLL_END.
	  Default binding is meta1-<.
	
	See Also:
	  BIND SCROLL_END
	  BIND SCROLL_FORWARD
	  BIND SCROLL_BACKWARD
bind self_insert
	Usage: BIND <key> SELF_INSERT
	  Causes the key it is bound to to insert itself into the input
	  buffer.  This is the default binding for the alphabet keys,
	  numbers, etc.  If this is bound to a meta sequence, it will
	  only insert the last key hit in the meta sequence.
	
	Note:
	  This is how you "unbind" a key.  
bind send_line
	Usage: BIND <key> SEND_LINE
	  This "sends" the input buffer to the server.  Well, really it
	  first expands aliases, etc...  but you get the idea.  It is
	  normally bound to the return key or enter key...  or both.
	
	See Also:
	  SENDLINE
bind shrink_window
	Usage: BIND <key> SHRINK_WINDOW
	  This function decreases the size of the current window by one row.

bind stop_irc
	Usage: BIND <key> STOP_IRC
	  Sends a Stop signal to IRC II, returning you to the shell.
	  Normally, you can then return to IRC II by typing fg.  Please
	  read about your shell to find out about this.  The default 
	  binding for stop_irc is meta2-^Z or for most people ^X^Z
bind switch_channels
	Usage: BIND <key> SWITCH_CHANNELS
	  Changes the current channel for the current window.  This will
	  only switch to a channel not currently directed to another
	  window.  That is, if you are on three channels, #Foo, #Bar,
	  and #Cheese, and #Foo and #Bar are currently directed to two
	  windows but #Cheese isn't, then SWITCH_CHANNELS will only
	  toggle between #Cheese and either #Foo or #Bar (depending upon
	  which window this is done in)
bind toggle_insert_mode
	Usage: BIND <key> TOGGLE_INSERT_MODE
	  Toggles the INSERT_MODE variable.  This function is equivalent
	  to doing:  
	    SET INSERT_MODE TOGGLE
bind toggle_stop_screen
	Usage: BIND <key> TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN
	  Stops and starts the screen display if it is scrolling madly
	  out of your control.  The display is also restarted after the
	  SEND_LINE function is executed.
bind transpose_characters
	Usage: BIND <key> TRANSPOSE_CHARACTERS
	  Swaps the two characters before the cursor. Thats all.
bind type_text
	Usage: BIND <key> TYPE_TEXT <string>
	  Causes the given string to be typed into the input buffer using
	  the current setting of the INSERT_MODE variable.
bind unstop_all_windows
	Usage: BIND <key> UNSTOP_ALL_WINDOWS
	  When activated, all currently stopped windows will be restarted.
bind yank_from_cutbuffer
	Usage: BIND <key> YANK_FROM_CUTBUFFER
	  Restores the last deleted thing.  The following functions store
	  what they deleted to the cutbuffer:
	    DELETE_NEXT_WORD
	    DELETE_PREVIOUS_WORD
	    ERASE_LINE
	    ERASE_TO_END_OF_LINE
bye
	See QUIT for more information about BYE.
c
	Usage: MODE [+|-]<modechars> [<parameters>]
	       MODE [+|-]b [<nick>[!<user>[@<host>]]]
	  Sets the current channel's mode. This is exactly the same as using
	  the MODE command with * as the first parameter.
	
	See also:
	  MODE
cd
	Usage: CD [<path>]
	  If a <path> is specified, this changes ircIIs working directory. 
	  This is the default directory for EXEC's and other things
	  (such as logs) that don't have absolute paths specified.
	  CD with no arguments shows you the current directory.

	  DCC CHAT
	  MSG
cignore
	Usage: CIGNORE [<channel>] [-][<message type>]
	
	  The standard form of CIGNORE allows you to specify which type of
	  messages you wish to ignore from a channel.  The message type
	  parameter can be one of the following:
	    MSGS            All MSGs received
	    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
	    CTCP            All CTCPs received
	    JOINS           Users joining channel
	    PARTS           Users leaving channel
	    KICKS           Users kicked from channel
	    MODES           Channel mode changes
	    TOPICS          Channel topic changes
	    CRAP            Anything else
	    ALL             All of the above message types
	    NONE            No message types
	
	  You can specify multiple types of messages to ignore on the
	  command line.  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of
	  ignoring of that type of message.  For example:
	    CIGNORE #Cheese MSGS KICKS
	  ignores MSGs and KICKs from #Cheese.  
	    CIGNORE #twilight_zone ALL -TOPICS
	  ignores all types of messages except TOPICS from #twilight_zone.
	
	  All forms of CIGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
	  and the type NONE will remove the channel from the list
	  completely.

	Usage: CLEAR [-ALL] [-UNHOLD]
	  Clears the current window.
	  If the -ALL flag is used, clears all visible windows.
	  If the -UNHOLD flag is used, unholds a window.
commands
	All IRCII commands typed on the command line must begin with one
	of the CMDCHAR settings (see SET CMDCHARS).  By default, this 
	is set to /.  Thus, any input line whose first character is a 
	/ is treated as an IRCII command. For example:
	
	/MSG BigCheese Howdy!
	
	This executes the MSG command, which sends a private message to 
	"BigCheese", and that message is "Howdy!"
	
	You can create aliases for commands or redefine what an existing
	command does.  This is done with the ALIAS command.  For example:
	
	/ALIAS M /MSG 
	
	NOTE: Command within aliases and other functions do not need the
	      CMDCHAR, and thus the above alias could be written as 
	      /ALIAS M MSG    as well.
	      The exception to this, is the // convention mentioned below.
	
	This example creates a new command, M, which does the same thing
	as MSG, you can now do:
	
	/M BigCheese Howdy!
	
	and it will work exactly like MSG.  Suppose however you did this:
	
	/ALIAS MSG //MSG BigCheese
	
	Now, the MSG command will only send messages to BigCheese:
	
	/MSG Howdy!
	
	Note that in the alias, there are two / in front of MSG.  Putting
	two of the CMDCHAR in front of a command tells IRCII that you
	want to use the original command, and not any alias of it.
	Therefore, even if you had the above alias for MSG, you could
	still do the following:
	
	//MSG Cheese I can still use the original MSG command.
	
	Furthermore, if you wish you can turn off your display 
	(See SET DISPLAY) for the duration of a command.  This is
	done by putting a ^ character between the / and the command
	word.  For example, if you do:
	
	/^MSG BigCheese Hello
	
	You will not see any visible effect to this command (unless the
	nickname BigCheese does not currently exist).
	
	Lastly, if you do the following:
	
	/ /this is a test
	
	Note there is a space after the /.  This form forces the following
	text to be sent to your current channel no matter what.  You can
	thus send lines that begin with your CMDCHAR.  It can also
	be used to force a message to your current channel when you are
	using QUERY.
comment
	Usage: COMMENT [<anything you want>]
	  This is a comment, it does nothing.
	  Useful in .ircrc files.
	
	  COMMENT, : and # are identical in operation.
connect
	Usage: CONNECT <serverX> [[<port>] <serverY>]
	  Tells <serverY> to attempt to connect to <serverX> on port <port>
	  with <port> defaulting to the default port for that server
	  (probably 6667) and <serverY> defaulting to the local server
	
	  CONNECT is a server operator command.

ctcp action
	Usage: CTCP <nick> ACTION <action description>
	  This command can be used to send a description of what you are doing
	  or how you are feeling or just about anything concerning you, to the
	  current channel or query.  It's just the low-level version of ME and
	  DESCRIBE.
	
	See Also:

	  DESCRIBE
ctcp clientinfo
	Usage: CTCP <nick> CLIENTINFO [<ctcpcommand>]
	  CLIENTINFO returns the known CTCP commands from another client in a list.
	  You can inspect commands further by calling 'CLIENTINFO VERSION' for
	  example. You will (or should) be given a one-line explanation of
	  what this command is supposed to do.
	
	  To find out about your own client services, execute a CLIENTINFO
	  on yourself: CTCP mynick CLIENTINFO
	
	Warning:
	  Some CTCP commands are not supposed to be sent by hand,
	  in particular ERRMSG, DCC, and SED.
ctcp
	Usage: CTCP <nick> <command> [<args>]
	  CTCP allows you access to the client-to-client protocol used
	  to perform certain client specific actions between different
	  clients on the network.  The CTCP mechanism works by sending
	  a specially coded message to another user whose client is
	  supposed to reply with a reply message of the type, or with
	  an error message, unless you sent it to a channel.
	
	  For example, if you do:
	    CTCP BigCheese VERSION	
	  you will receive:
	    *** CTCP REPLY VERSION from BigCheese: ircII 2.2.2 *IX.
	
	  The <command> field may be of several types, new ones are
	  introduced all the time, but there is a mechanism for you to
	  find out what you can use: see CLIENTINFO.
	  If the nickname is "*" the output is sent to the current channel.

ctcp echo
	Usage: CTCP <nick> ECHO <text>
	  Simply asks the remote client to return whatever <text> you send to it.
ctcp finger
	Usage: CTCP <nick> FINGER
	  FINGER will attempt to show the real name and idle time for the
	  specified nickname.
ctcp ping
	Usage: CTCP <nick> PING <current time>
	  Current time is the same as what the function $TIME() returns and
	  represents the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.  Other ircII
	  clients will take a CTCP ping and bounce the time back to you.
	  This CTCP function is used by the PING command.
	
	See Also:
	  PING
ctcp time
	Usage: CTCP <nick> TIME
	  TIME will return the current time for the nickname specified.
	  This differs from the /TIME command in that it asks the user's
	  client for the time instead of the user's server, which can 
	  be a long distance away.
ctcp userinfo
	Usage: CTCP <nick> USERINFO
	  USERINFO returns whatever information a person choses to put in their
	  USER_INFORMATION variable.  
	
	See Also:
	  SET USER_INFORMATION
ctcp utc
	Usage: CTCP <nick> UTC <system time>
	  This is primarily for robots to send date and time information
	  to users and have it displayed in local time. The format of the
	  UTC CTCP is:
	    UTC number
	  where number is the ASCII representation of the 32 bit
	  integer representing the time as is used on UNIX machines.
	  When IRCII receives this CTCP, it replaces the text of
	  the local time expressed in the local language back into
	  the original message. Thus if you send the following:
	    NOTICE nick The time is ^AUTC 702777074^A
	  The user might see:
	    -yournick- The time is Thu Apr  9 09:51:14 1992
	  (if their timezone is Australian Eastern Standard Time).
	  Obviously you can use the $TIME() function here effectively.
ctcp version
	Usage: CTCP <nick> VERSION
	  VERSION will show you the version of the client that a particular
	  person is using.
	
	Note:
	  SL0 means Script Level 0
cycle
	Usage: CYCLE [<channel>]
	  Leaves and rejoins a channel. If no channel is given, the current
	  channel is cycled.
	
	See Also:
	  JOIN
	  LEAVE
date
	Usage: DATE [<server>|<nickname>]
	  Shows the current time of day and date.  If a server is specified,
	  the time of day and date are reported from that server.
	  If a nickname is specified it shows you the above information
	  for that person's current server.
	
	  DATE and TIME are identical.

	Usage: DCC CHAT NICK
	  DCC CHAT initiates a direct client connection chat to the given
	  nick, who must respond with DCC CHAT. This is the most secure
	  form of communication available on IRC. Messages sent via a DCC
	  CHAT connection are not sent through IRC, but are sent by a direct
	  connection between your client and the remote client. Messages
	  are sent over a DCC CHAT connection with /MSG =nick

	   of connection, the nick of the person on the other end of the
	   connection, the current state of that connection and any other
	   information associated with that connection.
	
	See Also:
	  DCC CLOSE
dcc raw
	Usage: DCC RAW <fd> <host> <message>
	  After a connection has been established with the $CONNECT()
	  function DCC RAW is used to talk to that connection.  
	  $CONNECT(HOST PORT)  returns the (fd) of the connection 
	  which is then used by DCC RAW. E.g:
	    ALIAS socktest ECHO $connect(host 7)
	  Which will echo the file descriptor.
	
	  Then send messages to it with:
	    DCC RAW fd host message
	
	  These will be echoed back at you by the remote host.
	  Incoming messages can be intercepted with ON DCC_RAW.

	  Causes your server to exit, die, pack it in, give up the ship,
	  kick the bucket, etc.
	  DIE is a server operator command.
	
	2.8 Servers:
	  DIE may not work anymore on 2.8 servers.
digraph
	Usage: DIGRAPH [-<flag> [<arg0> <arg1> ...]]
	  A command for maintaining the internal digraph table.  See
	  BIND ENTER_DIGRAPH for information on entering digraphs.
	
	  Use the DIGRAPH command without any arguments to display the
	  current digraph table.  Note that if you are using a map
	  other than Latin-1, (your TRANSLATION variable is set to
	  something else than LATIN-1), many characters might be
	  converted on the screen to something that your terminal is
	  capable of displaying.
	
	Available flags:
	  -ADD <arg0> <arg1> <arg2>
	    Adds a digraph to the table, where <arg0> and <arg1> are the two
	    characters that should result in the digraph represented by the
	    character <arg2>. The arguments can be given in several formats.
	      DIGRAPH -ADD a b c
	    will result in a digraph entry for the letter "c", that will be given
	    by composing the letters "a" and "b".
	      DIGRAPH -ADD a b !c
	    would result in a digraph entry for the letter represented by an "a"
	    with a tilde above, which is the same as "c" with MSB (bit 8) set in the
	    ISO 8859/1 map.  The very same result is achieved with
	      DIGRAPH -ADD 61 62 227
	    thus giving the values in directly in decimal.
	    All modes can be combined.
	
	  -REMOVE <arg0> <arg1>
	    Removes a digraph entry in the table, in a similar fashion as
	    DIGRAPH -ADD.
	
	  -CLEAR
	    Removes ALL digraph entries from the table.
	    Use this command only if you know what you are doing.
	    It's primary use is when loading the .ircrc file.
	
	  If you do any changes in the digraph table, using -ADD,
	  -REMOVE or -CLEAR flags, they will be recorded in your .ircrc
	  file if you chose to save it.

disconnect
	Usage: DISCONNECT <server>
	  Disconnects you from a server.

	Usage: DLINE <host_mask> <reason>
	  Adds a D: line to the server config file. Note that some ircd
	  versions do not support this feature.
	
	See Also:
	  STATS
dmsg
	Usage: DMSG <nickname> <text>
	  Sends a private message over a DCC CHAT connection to the
	  nickname specified.
	
	  This command is equivalent to the following:
	
	    /MSG =<nickname> <text>

echo
	Usage: ECHO [<anything you want>]
	  This simply displays all of it's arguments.  However, it's not
	  that simple.  ECHO will work even if DISPLAY is set to OFF,
	  making it useful in your .ircrc file.  Also, ECHO will work in
	  the action portion of an ON command in all modes.  This can be
	  used to redefine the way messages appear.
	
	See Also:
	  ON

encrypt
	Usage: ENCRYPT [<nickname>|<channel> [<key>]]
	  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with 
	  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
	  key is specified, all messages you send to that 
	  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
	  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
	  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
	  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to 
	  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
	  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
	  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].
	
	  The <key> can be any text which is to be used an they key 
	  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
	  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon 
	  a key and how to communicate it to one another.
	
	  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
	  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
	  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
	    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
	  and user DogCheese must issue a 
	    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
	  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
	  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.  
	
	  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
	  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
	  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
	  displayed.
	
	  IrcII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
	  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
	  for information about this.
	 
	  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
	  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
	  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
	  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
	  appear in the input line.  
	
	Note:
	  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
	  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.

	HOW TO BEHAVE ON IRC
	
	Authors:      Lea Viljanen (LadyBug)  viljanen@kreeta.helsinki.fi
	              Ari Husa     (luru)     so-luru@tolsun.oulu.fi 
	Modified by:  Troy Rollo   (Troy)     troy@plod.cbme.unsw.oz.au
	
	
	
	1) Language
	
	   The most widely understood and spoken language on IRC is English. 
	However! As IRC is used in many different countries, English is by
	no means the only language. If you want to speak some other language
	than English (for example with your friends), go to a separate channel
	and set the topic (with /topic) to indicate that. For example
	   /topic Finnish only!
	would mean that this channel would be reserved for Finnish discussion.
	On the other hand, you should check the topic (with /list command) 
	before you move to a channel to see if there are any restrictions about 
	language.
	   On a channel not restricted by /topic, please speak a language
	everybody can understand. If you want to do otherwise, change channels
	and set the topic accordingly.
	
	
	2) Hello/Goodbye
	
	   It's not necessary to greet everybody on a channel personally.
	Usually one "Hello" or equivalent is enough. And don't expect everybody
	to greet you back. On a channel with 20 people that would mean one
	screenful of hellos. It's sensible not to greet, in order not to be rude
	to the rest of the channel. If you must say hello to somebody you know,
	do it with a private /msg. The same applies to goodbyes.
	
	   Also note that using IRCII's /ON facility to automatically say hello
	or goodbye to people is extremely poor etiquette. Nobody wants to receive
	autogreets. They are not only obviously automatic, but even if you think
	you are being polite you are actually sounding insincere and also
	interfering with the personal environment of the recipient when using
	autogreets. If somebody wants to be autogreeted on joining a channel,
	they will autogreet themselves.
	
	
	3) Discussion
	
	   When you come to a new channel it's advised you to listen
	for a while to get an impression of what's discussed. Please feel free
	to join in, but do not try to force your topic into the discussion
	if that doesn't come naturally.
	
	
	4) }{|`~][\@^
	
	   IRC has quite a lot of people from Scandinavian countries,
	the above characters are letters in their alphabet. This
	has been explained on IRC about a thousand and one times, so
	read the following, do not ask it on IRC:
	
	   {     is an A with 2 dots over it ()
	   }     is an A with a small circle above it ()
	   |     is either an O with 2 dots over it or an O with a dash (/)
	         through it (either  or )
	   `     is an e with an accent over it ()
	   ~     is an u with 2 dots over it ()
	   [, ], \, @ and ^ are the preceding five letters in upper case.
	
	Of course (I'm being ironical here), the both the french and the
	german mappings are DIFFERENT.
	
	
	5) ATTENTION!
	
	   Remember, people on IRC form their opinions about you only by 
	your actions, writings and comments on IRC. So think before you type.
eval
	Usage: EVAL <commands>
	  EVAL passes the commands through the inline parser and executes them.
	  This means that variables are expanded, and ;'s are honored.  
	
	Note:
	  You HAVE to use EVAL in a script if you want it to expand 
	  aliases and vars while it loads. The value of INPUT_ALIASES is
	  ignored when loading scripts.

	       EXEC -NAME <name> <shell commands>
	       EXEC -OUT [%<process id>|<shell commands]
	       EXEC -MSG <nickname> [%<process id>|<shell commands>]
	       EXEC -NOTICE <nickname> [%<pocess id>|<shell commands>]
	       EXEC -IN %<process id> <text to send to process>
	       EXEC -WINDOW [%<process id>|<shell commands>]
	       EXEC -<signal> %<process id>
	       EXEC -CLOSE %<process id>
	
	  EXEC allows you to start subprocesses in ircII and manipulate
	  them in various ways.  You can start multiple subprocesses
	  simultaneously and access them via a process number assigned
	  by ircII.  You can list all currently running subprocesses by
	  using EXEC with no parameters.  The process id of a process
	  is the number assigned by ircII for that process, or the 
	  name of the process given by the -NAME flag.  If a NAME is 
	  given to a process, that name may be used anyway in place of
	  the process number assigned by ircII.
	
	  The first form of EXEC will simply start a subprocess and send
	  it's output to your display.
	
	  The second form tells IRCII to send the output of the process
	  to your current channel.  For example:
	    EXEC -OUT ls
	  sends the output of ls to your channel.  
	    EXEC -OUT %1
	  tells ircII to send the output of subprocess 1 to your channel.
	  Subprocess 1 must exist already by a previous call to EXEC.
	
	  The third form is much like the second, except that it sends
	  to the specified nickname or nicknames (the format of the
	  nicknames is the same as for MSG).  As with the second form,
	  you can start a subprocess with -MSG, or you can change an
	  already running process to send it's output to the given nicknames.
	
	  The fourth form is identical to the first, except the messages
	  are send as NOTICEs not as PRIVMSG's.
	
	  The fifth form lets you send a line of input to a running
	  subprocess.  For example:
	    EXEC -IN %shell This is a test.
	  Sends "This is a test." to subprocess 0.  This processes must
	  have previously been started with a call to EXEC -NAME shell. 
	  An alternate method of sending text to processes is using the 
	  MSG or QUERY command.  In the place of a nickname, you may 
	  specify %n, when  n is a current running processes id.   For 
	  example:
	    MSG %shell This is a test.
	  is equivalent to the previous example.
	
	  The sixth form lets you specify that you want all output from
	  the process to go to the current window.  Normally, output
	  from processes goes to whichever window has a level setting of
	  CRAP.  This locks the output into the current window.  
	    EXEC -WINDOW %1
	  Sends the output of process 1 to the current window.
	
	  The last form lets you send various signals to subprocesses.
	  The allowable signals are:
	    HUP     INT     QUIT     ILL     TRAP     IOT     EMT
	    FPE     KILL    BUS      SEGV    SYS      PIPE    ALRM
	    TERM    URG     STOP     TSTP    CONT     CHLD    TTIN
	    TTOU    IO      XCPU     XFSZ    VTALRM   PROF    WINCH
	    LOST    USR1    USR2
	  What these signals do depends on the process running, etc.
	    EXEC -KILL %0
	  Sends a KILL signal to process 0, forcing it to exit
	  immediately.  If you want to read more about these signals, do
	  a "man kill" at your shell prompt.
	
	  The last form is for really ornery processes that simply won't
	  die.  Sometimes this is because an EXEC'd process has forked
	  off subprocesses which don't die when you use -KILL (or other
	  flag).  Doing a:
	    EXEC -CLOSE %0
	  closes all of ircII's connections to that processes.  This means 
	  that even if the processes is still sending output you won't see
	  it.  This also means (in most cases) that the process will be
	  killed by a SIGPIPE when it tries to send to ircII.

expressions
	  This help file describes expresssions available in ${}, and the
	  @, IF, WHILE, and FOREACH commands.
	
	  Variable expressions are used to perform arithmetic, string and
	  boolean operations. Their syntax is similar to the syntax of most
	  computer languages, and is modelled on C syntax. A simple example
	  of this, is that when ${A + 2} is used, and the ASSIGNed variable
	  A has the value '3', the result is 5.
	
	  Brackets can be used in these expressions, so (A+2)*3 would give a
	  value of (3+2)*3 == 15, whereas A+2*3 would give a value of 9, because
	  multiplication is performed before addition.
	
	  The common arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are all available.
	  Additionally, there is a string concatenation operator (##).
	  This treats both sides as strings and pastes them together. Thus
	  if A is 3 and B is 7, "A##B" becomes "37", but "A+B" becomes 10.
	
	  You can also assign values to a variable in these expressions
	  using the '=' operator. Thus if you have the expression "C = A+B",
	  it will assign the value 10 to C. This has a number of affects.
	  The most common case is the @ command, where you can enter this expression
	  literally:
	
	    @ C = A + B
	
	  The '=' operator returns the value assigned. Thus you can extend
	  this to:
	
	    @ D = C = A + B
	
	  Which will assign the value 10 to both C and D. In a $ expression,
	  you might want to assign a value to a variable, and display it at the
	  same time. Thus you might do the following:
	
	    echo The value of C is now ${C = A+B}
	
	  which would set C to 10 and display "The value of C is now 10".
	
	  Comparison operations also exist. These return 1 if the comparison is
	  valid (true) and 0 if it is invalid (false). The comparison operations
	  available are:
	
	    == (equal to)
	    >  (greater than)
	    >= (greater than or equal to)
	    <  (less than)
	    <= (less than or equal to)
	    != (not equal to)
	
	  Thus, the following expressions would result in the following results:
	   ( recall A = 3 and B = 7 )
	
		A == B			FALSE	0
		A == 3			TRUE	1
		A > 3			FALSE	0
		A >= 3			TRUE	1
		A != 3			TRUE	1
	
	  These expressions can be combined with || (OR), && (AND) and ^^ (XOR).
	  So (A == 3) || (B==3) would be TRUE, and (A == 2) && (B == 7) would be
	  FALSE. You can also negate expressions with ! (NOT), so !(A == 3) would
	  be FALSE. These boolean expressions are used primarily in IF and WHILE.
	
	  A string expression is considered to be true if it is non empty. So
	  if E has the value "word", then E || ( A > 3) is true, because E has
	  a non empty value, and !E is false.
	
	  Functions can also appear in expressions. The arguments to functions
	  are evaluated as normal $ type expressions. Thus the following alias:
	
	    alias test echo ${ MID(3 2 $0) + 5) }
	
	  is executed with /test 123456, would give  34 (Two digits from position 3
	  in $0) + 5, giving 39. If the function returns another function name, that
	  function name can be called with another set of brackets. Thus if you have
	  the following set of aliases:
	
	    alias fptr
	    {
	        if ( [$0] )
	            { @ function_return = func1 }
	            { @ function_return = func2 }
	    }
	    alias func1 @ function_return = this is $0
	    alias func2 @ function_return = that is $0
	    alias check echo ${ fptr($0)($1) }
	
	  then /check 0 1 would print "that is 1", and /check 1 0 would print
	  "this is 0".
	
	  Array expressions can also be used in this way. For example:
	
	    assign A.1.1 One One was a racehorse
	    assign A.1.2 Two Two was one too
	    assign A.2.1 One One won one race
	    assign A.2.2 Two Two won one too
	    alias rhyme echo ${ A[$0][$1] }
	
	  would cause /rhyme 2 1 to print "One One won one race".
	
	  Function and array expressions can be combined to give a form
	  of pointer arithmetic like that seen in C. If a function
	  RhymeNum exists as follows:
	
	    alias RhymeNum @ function_return = [A]
	  and rhyme is changed to:
	    alias rhyme echo ${ RhymeNum()[$0][$1] }
	
	  /rhyme 2 1 still prints "One One won one race". This is because
	  RhymeNum returns A, and the expression then becomes A[$0][$1].
	  The $0 is expanded to 2, so it becomes A.2[$1], and the $1 is
	  expanded to 1, so it becomes A.2.1, which is then substituted as
	  a variable for "One One won one race". The reverse is also possible.
	  For example, a robot might have the following:
	
	     alias thing.0 @ function_return = laughs his silly head off
	     alias thing.1 @ function_return = growls menacingly
	     alias thing.2 @ function_return = smiles like a crocodile
	     alias thing.3 @ function_return = wails uncontrollably
	     alias something SAY WereBot ${ thing[$RANDOM(4)]() }
	
	  Will cause WereBot to say that it's laughing itself silly, growling
	  menacingly, smiling like a crocodile or wailing uncontrollably.
	  Assuming RANDOM(4) results in a value of 2, This expands to
	  thing.2(), which is then considered to be a function and substituted
	  to "smiles like a crocodile", the end result being that WereBot will
	  say "WereBot smiles like a crocodile".
	
	  Finally, there are occasions when you need to get back to the $
	  substitution level. This can be done by enclosing text to be used at
	  this level in [..]. For example, [A] substitutes to a literal 'A', 
	  whereas A on its own substitutes to 3, and [$0] is needed to get
	  argument 0, because 0 on its own is taken to be the number 0.
	  Example:
	
	    alias something SAY WereBot ${ [$0][$RANDOM(4)]() }
	
	  will case /something thing to first expand [$0] to thing, giving
	  thing[$RANDOM(4)](), and if $RANDOM(4) returns 1, this becomes
	  thing.1(), which expands to "growls menacingly", and causes
	  WereBot to say "WereBot growls menacingly".
	
	
	  The following is the parse tree for expressions such as  those
	
		NU_EXPR = NU_CONJ
		NU_CONJ = NU_CONJ && NU_CONJ	|
			  NU_CONJ || NU_CONJ	|
			  NU_CONJ ^^ NU_CONJ	|
			  NU_ASSN
		NU_ASSN = varexp = NU_ASSN	|
			  NU_COMP
		NU_COMP = NU_COMP == NU_COMP	|
			  NU_COMP != NU_COMP	|
			  NU_COMP >  NU_COMP	|
			  NU_COMP >= NU_COMP	|
			  NU_COMP <  NU_COMP	|
			  NU_COMP <= NU_COMP	|
			  NU_ADD
		NU_ADD  = NU_ADD + NU_ADD	|
			  NU_ADD - NU_ADD	|
			  NU_ADD ## NU_ADD	|
			  NU_MULT
		NU_MULT = NU_MULT * NU_MULT	|
			  NU_MULT / NU_MULT	|
			  NU_UNIT
		NU_UNIT = token NUX_MODIF	|
			 unaryop token		|
			( NU_EXPR )		|
			[ expression ] NUX_MODIF
	
		NUX_MODIF = ( expression ) NUX_MODIF |
			    [ expression ] NUX_MODIF
	
	Special cases:
	  If a (...) or {...} construct is quoted with \(...\) or \{...\}
	  then variable expansion will take place on the first available
	  parse run.  However, after parsed, the \'s are eaten. e.g.
	    alias bonk echo ($0)        will return "($*)" regardless of
	  the argument to the alias.  No expansion takes place.  However, in
	    alias bonk echo \($0\)
	  expansion takes place as the special meaning of the () is taken
	  away by \.  This will return "(arguments to bonk)".

help
	Usage: HELP [<command> [<subcommands>]]
	  Shows help on the given command.  The help documentation is 
	  set up in a hierarchical fashion.  That means that certain
	  help topics have sub-topics under them.  For example, doing
	    HELP ADMIN
	  gives help on the admin command, while:
	    HELP SET
	  gives help on the set command and also displays a list of
	  sub-topics for SET.  To get help on the subtopics, you would
	  do:
	    HELP SET <subtopic>
	  where <subtopic> is one of the subtopics.  If you are using the 
	  built in help, then you need only type the subtopic name.  The
	  input prompt will indicate what help level you are on.  Hitting
	  return will move you up one level.  
	
	  At any time, you can specify a ? to get a list of subtopics 
	  without the associated help file, for example:
	    HELP ?
	  gives a list of all main help topics.  The following:
	    HELP BIND ?
	  gives the list of all BIND subtopics.  If you use a ? with 
	  a topic that has no subtopics, you will simply get the 
	  standard help file for that topic.
	
	Note:
	  Case is unimportant even when viewing the lower case
	  filenames such as 'newuser' or 'intro'.

hook
	Usage: HOOK <anything you want>
	  This command sends <anything you want> in such a way that it can

	  or any regular ON syntax. E.g. if you have
	    ON HOOK * echo one $* three
	  and you send
	    HOOK two
	  it will display "one two three" as the ON is activated.
	  This is useful if you want to put a special hook in a script or 
	  alias that you can act upon with an ON HOOK or ignore at will.

	  zero number. If the expression is true, the true-commands are
	  executed. If it is false, and the false-commands are given, they
	  are executed. Usually the expressions will be formed by using
	  combinations of the following:
		( exp )				( exp1 ^^ exp2 )
		( exp1 == exp2 )		( exp1 >= exp2 )
		( exp1 != exp2 )		( exp1 <= exp2 )
		( exp1 >  exp2 )		( exp1 || exp2 )
		( exp1 <  exp2 )		( exp1 && exp2 )
	        
	  Here exp is evaluated as though it were in ${} which means that 
	  if (blah)  expands the contents of $blah.  Numbers are treated 
	  as constants and thus to expand $0 it must be passed to the 
	  regular parser with [].   eg.  IF ([$0]) ...
	
	  IF (!exp)  is also possible which will negate a number or a string.
	  In the other expressions, if both exp1 and exp2 expand to numbers, 
	  then the following cause true-command to be executed:
		== 	if exp1 is equal to exp2
		!=	if exp1 is not equal to exp2
		>	if exp1 is greater than exp2
		<	if exp1 is less than exp2
		>=      if exp1 is greater than or equal to exp2
		<= 	if exp1 is less than or equal  to exp2
		^^ 	Logical XOR of exp1 and exp2 (1 ^^ 1) == 0 
	 		(1 ^^ 0) or (0 ^^ 1) == 1
		|| 	Logical OR of exp1 and exp2
		&&	Logical AND or exp1 and exp2
	
	  Otherwise, false-command (if present) is executed.
	  If both exp1 and exp2 are non-numeric, then the above operations
	  are string value comparisons.  And for the logical operations 
	  A NULL string is treated as 0 with the possible exception of the ^^
	  operator.
	
	  To put a string in an expression it must be passed to the 
	  regular parser with [].   eg IF ([string1] == [string2]) ..
	  All string comparisons are case-insensitive: so ([Hello]==[HELLO])
	  is true.  
	
	  Examples:
	    IF (C) { set input_prompt $C } { set -input_prompt }
	    IF (C!=0) { set input_prompt $C } { set -input_prompt }
	
	  Both of the above evaluate the same way, since $C will either expand 
	  to your current channel or 0 if none.  Notice the (C) format which 
	  means that it will expand exactly like ${C}.
	 
	  $ expansion is always performed on the contents of an the true-commands
	  and false commands, regardless of the setting of the INPUT_ALIASES
	  variable. 
	
	    IF (USER==[ms5n]) { echo Hello Mike! } { echo Who the hell are you? }
	
	  This example will look for an ASSIGN'd variable named USER, and if found
	  replace it and compare to ms5n.  If no ASSIGN'd variable exists, it
	  will check the environment variables for USER and return that.  
	
	    IF (index > max*2) { echo Limit reached }
	  This checks the ASSIGN'd variable against the ASSIGN'd variable
	  max times 2 and displays "Limit reached" if the first is greater than
	  the second. It does nothing if this is not true.
	
	  IF's can now be imbedded within each other. It is inconvient to write it 
	  out on a single line, so I will show the format needed in a script file.
	
	  if (time() - lasttime > 600)
	  {
	    if (thud == [gone home])
	    {
	      echo Bill went home over ten minutes ago
	      echo $stime($time())
	    }
	    {
	      echo Bill is still here.
	    }
	  }
	
	  This will first expand the function time() and the ASSIGN'd var 'lasttime'
	  to their current values, subtract (seconds) and see if its more than 
	  600 seconds, (10 minutes).  If that is true, then it checks to see if the
	  ASSIGN'd var 'thud' equals the string "gone home".  If that is ALSO true
	  then it will echo "Bill went home over ten minutes ago" and the current
	  date and time.  If the second IF is not true then it will display
	  "Bill is still here.".   Note there is no 'false' clause for the first
	  IF.

igh
	Usage: IGH <nickname> [<parameters>]
	  Ignores a user's host (*@*.host).
	
	See Also:
	  IGNORE
ign
	Usage: IGN <nickname> [<parameters>]
	  Ignores a user's user@host mask (*user@*.host).

	  IGNORE
ignore
	Usage: IGNORE [<nick>] [-|+|^][<message type>]
	       IGNORE [<user@host>] [-][<message type>]
	
	  The standard form of IGNORE allows you to specify which type of
	  messages you wish to ignore from a user.  The message type
	  parameter can be one of the following:
	    MSGS            All MSGs received
	    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
	    PUBLIC          All normal channel conversation
	    INVITES         All INVITEs received
	    WALLOPS         All WALLOPS received
	    NOTES           All NOTEs received
	    CTCP            All CTCPs received
	    CRAP            Anything else
	    ALL             All of the above message types
	    NONE            No message types
	    number          Remove ignore after number of minutes
	
	  You can ignore by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname
	  format.  Wildcards may be used in all formats.  You can specify
	  multiple types of messages to ignore on the command line.
	  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of ignoring of
	  that type of message.  For example:
	    IGNORE BigCheese MSGS INVITES
	  ignores MSGs and INVITES from BigCheese.  
	    IGNORE *@*.cmu.edu ALL -NOTES
	  ignores all types of messages except NOTES from anyone from CMU.
	
	  Temporary ignores can be placed by entering the number of minutes
	  an ignore should last as a parameter. For example:
	    IGNORE evenflow ALL 30
	  ignores all types of messages from evenflow for 30 minutes.
	
	  You may also specify a + before any message type to cause messages
	  of that type from that user to be displayed with the nickname
	  highlighted.  (See SET HIGHLIGHT_CHAR) For example:
	    IGNORE *Cheese* +MSGS
	  will cause all MSGs from anyone with Cheese in their nickname
	  to appear with their nickname highlighted.  
	    IGNORE * +PUBLIC +NOTES
	  will highlight all PUBLIC messages and NOTES received.  The + has no 
	  effect with the user@host name format.
	
	  If you specify a ^ before a message type, then messages from the
	  matching nicknames will be displayed no matter what.  This allows
	  you to exclude certain nicknames from larger matching lists.  For
	  example:
	    IGNORE * MSG
	    IGNORE BigCheese ^MSG
	  This will ignore private messages from everyone except BigCheese.
	  
	  All forms of IGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
	  and the type NONE will remove the user from the list
	  completely.  
	
	  All forms of IGNORE will match against the nickname with the
	  most true matching characters.  What this means is if you have:
	    IGNORE BigCheese MSGS
	    IGNORE * +ALL
	  Then MSG's from BigCheese will be ignored, and all other types
	  of messages from BigCheese will be unaffected.  All messages
	  of all types from any other user will be highlighted.
	
	See Also:
	  SET HIGHLIGHT_CHAR
info
	Usage: INFO [<server>]
	  Shows information about the IRC creators, debuggers, slaves and 
	  a lot of other people who no longer have much to do with irc.
input
	Usage: INPUT "<prompt>" <command> <args>
	  Where it displays "prompt" and then calls command, with args,
	  and with the line prompted for as $*.  The use of this is
	  strongly encouraged over the use of variable $"..". Similar
	  problems that occur in /wait. E.g:
	    ALIAS ex INPUT "Enter shell command >" exec $$*
intro
	Irc is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network.  It allows
	people all over the Internet to talk to one another in real-time.
	Each irc user has a nickname they use.  All communication with
	other users is either by nickname or by the channel that they or
	you are on.  All IRCII commands begin with a / character.
	Anything that does not begin with a / is assumed to be a message
	that is sent to everyone on your channel.  Here is a list of
	basic commands to help you get started:
	
	    /LIST		Lists all current irc channels, number of
				users, and topic.
	    /NAMES		Shows the nicknames of all users on each
				channel
	    /JOIN <channel>	Join the named channel.  All non-commands
				you type will now go to everyone on that
				channel
	    /MSG <nick> <msg>	Sends a private message to the specified
				person.  Only the specified nickname will
				see this message.
	    /NICK		Change your nickname
	    /QUIT		Exits irc.
	    /HELP <topic>	Gets help on all IRCII commands.
	    /WHO <channel>	Shows who is on a given channel,
				including nickname, user name and host,
				and realname.
	    /WHOIS <nick>	Shows the "true" indentity of someone
				Use this often to make sure you know who 
				you are talking to, because nicknames are
				NOT owned so any number of people could
				use a nickname.
	
	These commands should get you started on irc.  Use the /HELP
	command to find out more about things on irc, or ask question of
	people... most would be happy to help you out.
invite
	Usage: INVITE <nickname> [<channel>]
	  Invites another user to a channel.  If no channel is specified,
	  your current channel is used.  To go to the last channel to
	  which you were INVITEd, use
	    JOIN -invite

			NEW USER INFORMATION FOR IRC
	
	This file contains some caveats for people new to IRC. It is not a
	guide to commands for IRC. For a brief guide to commands for new
	users, see /HELP INTRO.
	
	See /HELP ETIQUETTE for a guide to good manners on IRC.
	
	IRC is an international network servicing 20 or more countries. There
	are over 10,000 registered users, and a similar number of regular
	unregistered users. Do not expect everybody to speak English.
	
	The primary means of identification is currently by nickname. This can
	be modified with /NICK, and registered with NickServ. (/MSG NickServ HELP
	for information on NickServ). Note, however that some nicknames are
	duplicated, and since unique nicknames CANNOT BE ENFORCED it is common
	to find someone else using a registered nickname.
	If you have any doubts about the identity of somebody using
	a given nick, use /WHOIS NickName to find out more. This gives detailed
	information on the person using the NickName. For example, if you
	are getting abusive messages from "Fred", type:
	
	/WHOIS Fred
	
	If the information displayed is not the same as that which you would
	expect for Fred, it is probably a case of impersonation.
	
	Recently some users have been tricking others into allowing them to
	control their IRC sessions or damaging their files. If somebody asks
	you to type a command and you don't know what it does, use
	/HELP CommandName to find out more about it first. In particular,
	/ON has been used to cause trouble and is now initially disabled
	for new users. Additionally, /QUI is short for /QUIT and will
	terminate your IRC session. If you see any message asking you to
	type /QUI or /QUIT, ignore it.
	
	Some new users have been baffled by "CTCP" messages appearing on
	the IRC session. These are messages from other users, asking your
	client to perform some service for them. They are generally
	generated by somebody typing in a CTCP command. See /HELP CTCP.
	
	If you have not already done so, read the HELP files INTRO and
	ETIQUETTE.
ison
	Usage: ISON <nick1> [<nick2> ...]
	  The ISON command is typically not used by an IRC user, rather it
	  is used by the IRC client for the NOTIFY command.  It asks the
	  IRC server if the nicknames are present on IRC.
	
	See Also:
	  USERHOST
j
	See JOIN for more information about J.
join
	Usage: JOIN [-INVITE|<channel_list> [<key>]]
	  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.
	  If no parameters are given, your current channel is displayed.
	
	  Channel names begin with a # or & and may contain any character
	  except space, carriage return, null and line feed. For example,
	  #My_Channel, # or #!@$%^&* are valid channel names.
	  Channel names beginning with the character '&' are local to your server.
	
	  If the specified channel does not already exist, it will be created.
	  Otherwise, if MODE +k <key> is enabled on the channel, you will have to
	  supply the <key> to complete join.
	
	Available flags:
	  -INVITE
	    If the -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
	    last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
	    you will join the channel to which you were last invited.
	
	Note:
	  Joining a channel does not cause you to leave your previous
	  channel unless NOVICE is set to ON. See SET NOVICE
	  If you have NOVICE off, it is possible to join several channels
	  at the same time.. with
	    JOIN #channel1,#channel2,#channel3
	  You must use commas and no spaces to separate the channel names.
	
	  CHANNEL and JOIN are identical.
	
	See Also:
	  SET NOVICE
	  MODE for information about changing channel characteristics.
k
	Usage: K <nickname> [<reason>]
	  Kicks a user from the current channel.
	
	See Also:
	  KICK
kb
	Usage: KB [<timeout>] [<channel>] <nickname> [<reason>]
	  Kicks and bans a user from a channel.
	
	  If a timeout value is entered, the ban will be removed after that
	  many number of minutes.
	
	See Also:
	  BAN
	  KICK
kick
	Usage: KICK *|<channel> <user> [<comment>]
	  Kicks specified user off a given channel.  Only channel operators
	  are privileged to use this command.  Channel operator privileges
	  can be given to other users of channel using:
	    MODE <channel> +o <user>
	  and taken away with:
	    MODE <channel> -o <user>
	  KICK * <user> is just like the first usage but it always specifies
	  the current channel.  So 
	    KICK * idiot
	  will kick 'idiot' off your current active channel.
	
	  KICK can be very effective if used in a combination with
	    MODE #channel +i
	  and possibly
	    MODE #channel +b.
	  First line of defense should be IGNORE and KICK then then the
	  channel can be made invite only, and if all else fails a person
	  can be banned from the channel.
	 
	  The <comment> is to supply some reason for the kick to the user
	  affected as well as to other people on your channel.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	  Be careful with your use of KICK and MODE #channel -o
	  as they can throw the network permanently out of sync.  This
	  generally occurs when two people are bickering about channel op
	  status and de-op each other.  This generates 'Fake MODE' notices
	  which are an indication that something is wrong.  The best way
	  to avoid this is to not use ON and MODE together.
	
	See Also:
	  MODE
	  IGNORE
kill
	Usage: KILL <nickname> <comment>
	  Removes a person from irc.  This is an operator command
	  and should be used with extreme caution (if at all). The
	  comment is necessary to let others the reason for the kill.
	  If you don't give a comment, you will probably be bombarded
	  with messages saying "why the kill?"
	
	  Regarding so called 'ghosts'.  These are generated typically when
	  someone accidently does a shell escape out of irc, (see BIND STOP_IRC)
	  and they start a new process.  They think the old one is a 'ghost'.
	  The way to get rid of these ghosts is to QUIT the current session
	  and type 'ps -gx' or 'ps -f' at the unix command prompt.
	  This will generate a listing looking something like.
	    unix> ps -gx
	      PID TT STAT   TIME COMMAND
	    15472 p8 S      1:20 irc Daemon
	  Where all the user has to do now is type 
	    unix> kill -9 15472
	  and the problem is fixed.  This is preferable to the IRC KILL command
	  which is not 100% effective. kill -9 is.
	
	  If you cannot manage to get the above to work, try typing at the unix
	  command prompt:
	    kill -9 -1
	  This will often kill all your processes, then you only have to log in again.
	
	  With the advent of auto-reconnecting clients KILL is almost
	  totally worthless as a tool for punishment.   More effective
	  methods to deal with obnoxious people are the IGNORE, KICK
	  and various MODE's on channels, such as +i and +b.
	
	See Also:
	  MODE
	  IGNORE
kline
	Usage: KLINE [<time>] <userhost_mask>[,<another>[...]] <reason>
	  Adds a K: line to the server config file. If a time is given, the
	  kline will last for that given number of minutes. Note that some ircd
	  versions do not support the temporary kline feature.
	
	  Multiple klines with the same reason can be sent in succession
	  quickly by separating the userhost masks and/or nicknames by commas.
	  For example:
	    /KLINE nick1,*user@*host2,nick3,nick4,*user@*host5 this is the reason
	
	See Also:
	  FINDK
	  UNKLINE
l
	See LEAVE for more information about L.
lastlog
	Usage: LASTLOG [<flag>] [[<pattern>]|[<number of entries> [<from entry>]]]
	  Displays the contents of the lastlog.  This is a list of the
	  most recent messages that have appeared on the screen.  LASTLOG
	  is useful to redisplay the screen if you inadvertantly do a
	  CLEAR or miss messages for other reasons.
	
	  If no arguments are given, the entire lastlog is displayed. If the
	  first argument is a number, it determines how many log entries to show.
	  Otherwise it is searched for in every lastlog entry. The second
	  argument determines how many lines back to start display from. Thus
	    LASTLOG 4 8
	  Shows 4 lines of the lastlog, starting at line 8...  lines 8,
	  9, 10, 11 are displayed.  Furthermore:
	    LASTLOG bigcheese
	  displays only those lastlog entries that contain the word "bigcheese".  
	
	Available flags:
	  You can further limit the display of the lastlog by specifying
	  one of the following flags:
	    -PUBLIC         Normal channel messages
	    -MSG            Private messages
	    -NOTICE         Notices
	    -NOTE           Notes
	    -WALL           Walls
	    -WALLOP         Wallops
	    -CRAP           Anything not included in the other categories
	    -LITERAL        Make the follow a pattern always, not a number
	
	  The lastlog will only display messages of the type specified
	  by the flag.
	  
	See Also:
	  SET LASTLOG
	  SET LASTLOG_LEVEL
leave
	Usage: LEAVE <channel>
	  Leave a channel.   This is used to leave a single channel.
	  It no channel is specified your current active channel is 
	  assumed.
	    LEAVE *
	  also assumes your current channel.
	
	  PART and LEAVE are identical.
	
	See Also:
	  JOIN
	  SET NOVICE
links
	Usage: LINKS [[<server>] <wildcard>]
	  Shows all of the servers currently connected to the IRC network.
	  If <wildcard> is specified, LINKS shows any servers
	  that match the given expression.
	
	  If a <server> is specified, it's asked for the relevant information.
	    LINKS *.au coombs*
	  will query whatever server is calling itself *.au for a list of
	  servers matching coombs*, then send the information back to you.
list
	Usage: LIST [<flag> [<arg>]] [<channel>] 
	  LIST gives you a listing of channels which includes channel name,
	  number of users, and a topic (if one is set).  If no channel
	  is specified, all channels are shown, otherwise only channels
	  that match are displayed (the channel may contain wildcards)
	  If the channel given is the character "*" LIST only returns the 
	  information for the current channel.
	  The displayed list may also be limited by using one or more of 
	  the following flags:
		-MIN n		When n the minimum number of user.  Channels
				with less than n users are not shown.
		-MAX n		When n the maximum number of user.  Channels
				with more than n users are not shown.
		-PUBLIC		Only shows Public channels
		-PRIVATE	Only shows Private (*) channels
		-ALL		Overrides previous -PUBLIC and/or -PRIVATE
		-TOPIC		Show channels with topic set
		-WIDE		Shows channel names and sizes in as little
				space as possible. Listing can be sorted using:
			-NAME	Sort by name of the channel
			-USERS	Sort by number of users in the channel

load action
	Usage: LOAD action
	  Several Multi-User-Dungeon-like aliases are defined here.
	  They make use of the ME command, and are transmitted to

		NOD		PURR		SCRATCH		SHRUG
		SIGH		SMILE		WAVE		WINK
		YAWN
	
	  These act differently depending on presence of arguments:
		LAUGH [<how>]	SING [<lyrics>]
	
	  The following can only be used without arguments.
		BOW		BURP		COUGH		CRY
		GASP		SCREAM		SHIVER		SNAP
		SNEEZE		SNORE		WHISTLE		WIGGLE
	
	  These instead, require a nickname as argument
	  (or 'you' if you are in a /query):
		COMFORT		CUDDLE		HUG		KISS
		LOVE		PAT		POKE		SLAP
		SPIT		THANK
	
	  These can be used with or without a nickname:
		DANCE		SHAKE
	
	  Some of these commands use a possessive pronoun, the pronoun
	  is generated at loading time depending on the setting of a
	  variable 'GENDER'. If you care, you should include a line
	
		assign gender f
	
	  (or 'm' for male) in your .ircrc before 'load action'.
	  However sentences will make sense even if GENDER is undefined.
	
	  New commands have been added which act like 'private-msg actions':
		PING <person> [<beeps to wake person up>]
	  and	PONG <person>

load autoop
	Usage: LOAD autoop
	  There have been all too many complaints over the years the the current
	  automatic chanop alias and such act too fast, and thus you get this
	  slew of garbage as 10 people all op the same person the instant they
	  join the channel.  This script tries to alleviate this problem in the
	  following manner.  When someone on your autoop list joins a channel
	  on your channel list, the client will wait 10 seconds + a random
	  time and then CHECK to see if that person is opped yet, and if not,
	  op them.  This allows people to do it by hand in the meantime, but
	  it should cut the number of repetitive MODE commands by about 90%.
	
	  The other big feature of this script is the user-friendly interface.
	  Try it, use it, and remember BE PATIENT.  It will work, it just isn't
	  instant.  It's designed to work the way it does for a reason.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  showop	Show list of people on autoop list.
	  showchan	Show list of channels for which you will op people
	  addop		Add a nick!user@host to the autoop list. wildcards are allowed
	  addchan	Add a #channel to the channel list. wildcards are allowed
	  delop		Delete an item from the op list by number.  Use showop first.
	  delchan	Delete a channel from the channel list. Use showchan first.
load basical
	Usage: LOAD basical
	  Basical aliases are defined here, so to make ircII behave according
	  to the old ircI standards. This script should always be loaded from
	  the global ircrc, you should already have these things defined.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  CHOP <nick>	   Make a person channel-op of your current channel.
	  K <nick>         Kick person from current channel.
	  MO <modechange>  Make a mode change on the current channel.
	  UMODE <mode>     Make a mode change upon yourself (user mode).
	  UNCHOP <nick>    Remove channel-operator status from person.
	  WDETECTED        Whois of the last person detected by /notify.
	
	  These were kept for compatibility:
	  DMSG             Send a message through a DCC CHAT link.
	  DQUERY           Enter query with a person on a DCC CHAT link.
	
	  ^r is bound to type the 'reverse' character.
	  Also some output representations are fixed.
load bigcheese
	Usage: LOAD bigcheese
	  This is simply BigCheese's .ircrc file.  It has many useful features
	  such as a quick way to reference people when using MSG and other
	  stuff too numerous to mention.  Use WHICH to find the script and then
	  look through it.
load brc
	Usage: LOAD bitnet
	  BITNET aliases and settings are defines here to make ircII look
	  and feel like the BITNET Relay Chat (BiRC).
	  Some of the BiRC commands can't be found in IRC, and some of the
	  commands will display different outputs than those in BiRC.
	  The display will reassemble as much of the BiRC that is possible.
	
	  This script is version 1.00, Patchlevel 1
	  This script is Copyright (C) Ove Ruben R Olsen (Gnarfer)
	  The commands below are taken from the BiRC /Help command.

load channel
	Usage: LOAD channel
	  Makes the /channel command act differently from /join.
	    CHANNEL <new channel>
	  will now leave the current channel before joining a new one.
load columns
	Usage: LOAD columns
	  A little script by BigCheese to demonstrate the usage of ECHO $[].
	  It displays all in and outgoing channel talk formatted to the 11th
	  column.
load commander
	Usage: LOAD commander
	  This file contains a big set of key bindings, one command for
	  almost every key you have on your keyboard, prefixed by ESC.
	  Here's the definition of the keys after pressing ESC:
	    A	Prompts you for an away message, ENTER will un-away you.
	    C	Shows you the /NAMES entry of your current channel.
	    D	Shows the Who-list of people of your country. ( = /countrywho )
	    E	Prompts you for the launch of an external command with /EXEC.
	    F	Follows an invitation to a channel.
	    G	"Greet" - Enter a query with the last person whose signon has been
			detected by /notify.
	    H	"Here" - Shows Who-list of users from your site. ( = /localwho )
	    I	Invite the user who last sent you a message to the current channel.
	    J	Shows the WHOIS of the person who last joined your channel.
	    L	List of channels with at least 3 persons on unless with topic.
	    M	"More" - Enter a query with the person you last sent a msg to.
	    N	Names list of public channels having at least 2 persons on.
	    O	Who-list of operators online.
	    P	Make your channel private.
	    Q	Quit querying.
	    R	"Reply" - Enter a query with the person who last sent you a msg.
	    S	Prompts you for a new server, ENTER gives a list of stored ones.
	    T	Prompts you for a topic for the current channel.
	    U	Tells you how many users and servers are on IRC. ( = /lusers )
	    W	Gives you the Who-list of the people on your channel.
	    X	"eXamine" - WHOIS of the person who last sent you a message.
	    Y	Toggles the SCROLL mode.
	    Z	Toggles the HOLD_MODE.
	    ,	Flushes the server output.
	   TAB	Clears the window.
load cursor
	Usage: LOAD cursor
	  I don't know why it works on some terminals, on others it doesn't.
	  This should setup ircII to make the cursor keys on your terminal move
	  the cursor in ircII left/right and forward/back in command history.
	  Try it, maybe you are lucky.
load dccchan
	Usage: LOAD dccchan
	  DCC based channels.  DCC channels work similar to other servers, except
	  that they are just another channel, not a full server.  This implementation
	  also has the limit of one DCC channel per client.
	
	  To use:
	    /makeid <nick>          - creates a unique nickid for you
	    /openport <port>        - create a dcc channel on port <port>
	    /closeport <port>       - close a dcc channel on port <port>
	    /opencon <host> <port>  - connect to port <port> on host <host>
	    /whoon                  - list who is on the channel
	
	  Use the /d_msg command to send a message to the channel.  You can also use
	  /query /d_msg to achieve the same
load deutsch
	Usage: LOAD deutsch
	  This is only for the german-speaking part of the IRC community.
	  Hier ist nix sinnvolles drin, nur eine kleine Sammlung von Tastenbelegungen,
	  die mit META2 erreichbar ist. META2 ist per default auf ^w gelegt (CTRL-W).
		f	*fauch*
		g	*grins*
		G	*gaehn*
		k	*kicher*
		l	*lach*
		M	moin <letzter joiner>!
		R	rehi <letzter joiner>!
		s	*seufz*
		S	*schmoll*
		t	*troest*
		T	tach <letzter joiner>!
load disc
	Usage: LOAD disc
	  A simple demonstration of how to customize the STOP_IRC binding
	  so as to set your away message automatically. Use the WHICH
	  command to find the script, and then look at what it does. This
	  one should be copied into your .ircrc or a separate file in your
	  own account.
load edit
	Usage: LOAD edit
	  Edit a loaded alias on the command line.
	 
	  Usage:  /edit alias_name
	  This will take the matching alias and put it in the command
	  line to be edited at will.  The alias name may be abreviated
	  if there are no other matching aliases.
	
	Note: If you are using a client version less than ircII2.2.2
	  this script may not work reliably, as it has to define
	  it's own 'xtype' alias.
load english
	Usage: LOAD english
	  For those who didn't like that ircII has special features for germans
	  only, here is just about the same silly thingie in english language.
	  This might however become obsolete if ME & co. become a standard.
	
	  If you load this script you get the following strings typed into your
	  ircII line as you type META2, that is usually ^w (CTRL-W), plus one
	  of the letters listed here:
		a	*applaud*
		A	*gasp*
		b	*blush*
		B	*bow*
		c	*cry*
		C	*cough*
		f	*frown*
		g	*grin*
		G	*giggle*
		h	*hug*
		k	*kiss*
		l	*laugh*
		r	*purr*
		s	*sigh*
		S	*shrug*
		y	*yawn*
load events
	Usage: LOAD events
	  This script contains a collection of ON commands which change the looks
	  of some 'events' to something that I like more. Maybe you like it, too?
	
	  The person's nickname that last sent you a message will appear in
	  your status-line, if you have %U in your STATUS_FORMAT variable.
	  The output of NAMES will look more compact.
	  The output of WHO will look less confusing, too. Same goes for LIST.
	  When you type to a channel your nickname will be displayed as prefix to
	  the line instead of just '> '.
	  You will be informed about the time every full hour.
load extensions
	Usage: LOAD extensions
	  This one is usually loaded automatically anyway by the 'global' script.
	  It simply defines 'umode', 'dmsg', and 'dquery' thus taking the 
	  burden off the client itself to deal with them.
load finger
	Usage: LOAD finger
	  This script allows one to finger someone's account.  The format is:
	  finger nickname          display the finger for that nickname
	  finger -h nickname       display the finger of that nickname's host
	  finger user@some.host    display the finger of the given user@host
	  finger @some.host.name   display a finger @some.host.name
	  finger                   shows the format.
load finger.who
	Usage: LOAD finger.who
	  This is just a rewrite of the FINGER script, but this one is supposedly
	  more efficient.  
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  FINGER <nickname>
	    should find and finger that person's account.
load flood
	Usage: LOAD flood
	  Simply activates flood control if someone dumps to you, with the
	  exception of nickserv, noteserv, etc..  They may dump on you.

	See Also:
	  HELP
	  SET HELP_PATH
load history
	Usage: LOAD history
	  Let's you use a few special escape sequences in a line.
	    !$           expands to the last word in the previous line
	    !0 !1 ... !9 expand to the first ten words in the last line entered
	    !*           expands to all but the first word in the last line entered

	  in this script, thus  ^K-h will turn it on and off.
load irciihelp
	Usage: LOAD ircIIhelp
	  This simply emulates an ircIIhelp robot.  It will send help on a 
	  subject to anyone who asks for it. Actual ircIIhelp robots however

	  This script provided Nicolas.Pioch@grasp.insa-lyon.fr (Nap) as an
	  example for the "IRCprimer" IRC guide available in PostScript,
	  plain text or .tex (LaTeX source code).
	
	  This is a simple script from the IRCprimer, which tries to implement
	  various things such as shortening all useful commands to a single
	  letter, speeding up scroll speed two times and displaying useful
	  information whenever needed.

load kickmenu
	Usage: LOAD kickmenu
	  This is a script for getting rid of trouble makers REAL quick on a 
	  channel.  If you can figure out how it works, then  you might find
	  it useful.
load killpath
	Usage: LOAD killpath
	  Tired of looking at 6 lines of garbage every time first.etc.ba.ca
	  kills someone?  Well this script is for you.  It will reduce the 
	  length of both serverkills and oper kills to a single line.  
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  KPATH
	    will show you the last kill path for when the information will be useful.
load kpstat
	Usage: LOAD kpstat
	  This is based on the killpath script but it displays serverkill
	  messages in your status line instead of on the screen, making them
	  flash by.  This is good if you want to know something is going on
	  but don't want it to fill your screen.
load list
	Usage: LOAD list
	  Adds the 'show' command.  If you know what it does, tell me.
load
	Usage: LOAD [-args] <filename> [<arg0> <arg1> ...]
	  Loads the given file into irc, treating each line as an irc
	  command, just as if it were typed into the command line, but it
	  expects commands to not have leading command characters, for
	  compatibility it is however allowed. LOAD is the command used
	  automatically at irc startup to load the .ircrc file.
	
	  In a LOAD script it is allowed to have leading spaces and tabs
	  before the commands.
	
	  A long line, like a long alias definition, can be split over
	  multiple lines by putting { and } around it like this:
	    alias follow {
	      say sorry folks, got invited away
	      join -i;bow
	      say here i am especially for you
	      grin
	    }
	
	  This format _MUST_ be used, you cannot put the { in the next
	  line and you cannot put the } elsewhere than by itself.
	  It is also not allowed to use { { } } constructs.
	
	  If the -args flag is specified, then each
	  line of the loaded file is alias expanded before it is executed,
	  just as if you had INPUT_ALIASES set to ON.  The optional
	  arguments, arg0 arg1 etc, are then used to expand the argument
	  expandos ($*, $1, $2, etc) for each line.  The -args switch
	  takes precedent over any changes of the setting of INPUT_ALIASES
	  in the loaded file.  If you only want to expand certain lines
	  and not others, use EVAL to evaluate the given line expanding 
	  variables.  The default value for INPUT_ALIASES is now OFF
	  when loading a script.
	  Note also that the default value for DISPLAY is OFF as well.
	
	  Commands separated by ';' are not recognized by LOAD, that syntax
	  is for ALIAS, BIND and ON only.
	  
	  The location of scripts should be shown in your LOAD_PATH variable
	  which can be changed to point to your own scripts if needed.

load local
	Usage: LOAD local
	  Local definitions, done by your ircII administrator, are stored in here.
	  Local is executed at ircII startup automatically.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  The most important aliases in here, are these two aliases:
	    COUNTRYWHO	Who-list of the people of your country.
	    LOCALWHO	Who-list of the people at your site.
	
	  With 'commander' you have these commands on ESC-d and ESC-h respectively.
load lynx_ircrc
	You could make up a nice .ircrc to start with, simply by writing these 3
	lines into it:
	  load basicall
	  load commander
	  load events
	  load alias
	
	Read the helps to learn about what you get by using these scripts.
	They are designed to bring much of ircII's power to the user's
	disposition which is otherwise hard to get, because you'd have to learn
	ircII's complex and unfriendly programming language.
	
	### Editor's note:  The above paragraph may not reflect the views of the
	   other client coders or the views of those that program in the ircII
	   script language. 
	
	About the key definitions in 'commander', you get much faster in discussion
	if you get acquainted to their use, especially the fast QUERY bindings
	which can help you switch between multiple conversations quickly.

load meta1
	Usage: LOAD meta1
	  Both the ESCAPE and ` keys are defined as META1 control key,
	  so if you do not have ESC you can use `.
	  To obtain a ` you must type ` twice. If you type ESCAPE twice
	  you'll get the ircII command completion function instead.
	
	  This script is provided for those, who switch terminals very
	  often and some terminals don't have ESC in the left upper corner.
	  The "`" which in those cases usually is there instead of ESC
	  will then act as META1, too.
load meta2
	Usage: LOAD meta2
	  TAB is redefined to do META2.
	  Pressing TAB twice toggles the insert mode.
load msg
	Usage: LOAD msg
	  Contains some handy key bindings:
	  A variable LAST_WHOIS will always contain the person you last /whois'd.
	  A variable LAST_NOTIFY will contain the person that was last detected to
	  sign onto irc.
	
	  By typing META2 with ? you will be prompted 'MSG <last_whois> '
	  With META2 and ! you'll get 'MSG <last_notify> '
	
	  Additionally you also have META2-, which expands to
	    MSG <last person that sent you a msg> 
	  and META2-. to
	    MSG <last person you sent a msg to> 
	  analogue to the standard IRC shortcuts ('MSG .' and 'MSG ,').
	
	  META2 is defined by /bind, by default it is ^x.

	  LOAD commander
load mudlike
	Usage: LOAD mudlike
	  ircII interface for people who like the way one communicates on MUDs.
	  It makes ircII act almost the same way:
	
	  Removes the / before commands, everything you type is supposed to be
	  a command. To speak to a channel use 'SAY <text>', to speak to a person
	  use 'TELL <person> <text>' or use 'QUERY <person>' and 'SEND <text>'.
	
	  When you 'LOAD action' you get the 'smile', 'grin' etc. commands which
	  ALSO transmit over a query! So be careful if you are in a query or not.
	  The ' symbol itself is a quickie for the 'send' command which either
	  sends to the query or the channel, therefore behaving as in MUDs.
	
	  If you type one space before text, that is space as a command like this:
	  ' <text>', it always goes to the channel.
	  Much of the irc output is modified in a way that it looks more familiar
	  to MUDders.
	
	  'emote' is defined as 'me'.

load nemesis
	Usage: LOAD nemesis
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  NEMESIS
	    Opens a window and connects to the Nemesis MUD in Munich, Germany.
	    It will automatically close the window when the connection closes.
	    This shows how to use ircII as a MUD client.
	  NWHO
	    Shows the 'who' list of Nemesis. A service provided by the Nemesis
	    IRC service robot which other MUDs do not have. The robot is actually
	    a small LPC program running within the Nemesis system driver.
	  NTELL <nemesian> <message>
	    Will send a message onto the screen of a person in Nemesis, (a
	    Nemesian).  The person is capable of answering to you, if (s)he
	    knows how (See 'help ircgate' within Nemesis).
load netsplit
	Usage: LOAD netsplit
	  In it's current incarnation this is undoubtably the most complex
	  ircII script ever written.  What it does is reduce a whole series
	  of Signoffs due to a 'netsplit' (two servers breaking somewhere) 
	  to a single line
	    *** Netsplit (server1 server2)
	  Not only that but it will also reduce ALL of those people coming 
	  back to a single line as well.. 
	    *** Netjoined (server1 server2) 
	  All other Signoffs and joins are handled normally.   It currently
	  handles multiple splits, and multiple channels.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  WHOLEFT
	    shows who is gone and from what channels, and what servers broke.
	  NETPURGE
	    cleans out all the old garbage. This is done automagically every minute.
load newaway
	Usage: LOAD newaway
	  Remembers old away's and does reshow any (except in WHOIS
	  output).
load nicks
	Usage: LOAD nicks
	  This is bigcheese's script for making quick aliases for when you 
	  want to send messages to someone. Example:  
	    ASSIGN BC Bigcheese
	    MSG bc <message>
	  This will send your message to bigcheese while you only have to type
	  the short name.
load oldping
	Usage: LOAD oldping
	  This was the last ping script made for ircII2.2pre7
	  Its use is highly discouraged: ircII2.2 has a PING command
	  and thus does not need a ping alias.  If you need to ping someone
	  you know is using an old client, then you can load this script
	  and it should work.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  PING <nickname> will hopefully give you a response that 
	  will tell you how long it took to send a message to that person 
	  and to get a reply.  Not all clients answer automatically, so 
	  don't expect it to always work.
load oper
	Usage: LOAD oper
	  A collection of aliases for IRC operators.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  So you don't have to type the port number:
	    STICK <new> <target>	/connect <new> 6667 <target>
	  So you don't have to type the channel name:
	    joinzone	join #Twilight_Zone
	    partzone	part #Twilight_Zone
	    joineuop	join #EU-Opers
	    parteuop	part #EU-Opers
	    joinusop	join #US-Opers
	    partusop	part #US-Opers
	    joinozop	join #OZ-Opers
	    partozop	part #OZ-Opers
	
	Note:
	  The wallops automatisms are now handled by the
	  new script called 'wallopstat'.

	  LOAD WALLOPSTAT
	  LOAD KPSTAT
	  CONNECT
load prefix
	Usage: LOAD prefix
	  For those who use multiple channels without opening windows
	  for each of them. The channel name talk is coming from or going
	  to is displayed as prefix to each line.
load recursion
	Usage: LOAD recursion
	  These are just a bunch of useful examples of recursive aliases.
	  Stuff like.. 
	    conbunch <server list>		Connect to several servers.
	    squitbunch <server list>		Squit several servers.
	    versbunch <server|user list>	check version for several servers
	  and my favorite
	    opalot <+/-> <nickname list>	Op or deop several people.
	  
	  There are more.. Take a look at the file and the format of how things
	  are done.  And be sure to remember the MAX_RECURSIONS limit.
	
	See Also:
	  SET MAX_RECURSIONS
load repeat
	Usage: LOAD repeat
	  This is a sample of using the WHILE command in an alias.  Once
	  loaded, here is it's usage:
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  REPEAT <count> <cmd>
	  This will perform <cmd> for the number of times specified by
	  <count>. For example:
	    REPEAT 5 /msg bigcheese Hello!
	  This will send the message "Hello!" to bigcheese 5 times.  
	  The above example can get annoying, so try to not to use
	  this to really bother people.
	
	Note: repeat is an excellent example of how to use the WHILE
	  construct.   Included in this script is the RECREPEAT command
	  which works just like REPEAT but does so using recursion.
	  Both are good simple examples.
load screen
	Usage: LOAD screen
	  This script allows you to use ircII windows in a similar fashion
	  to iScreen windows.  Here's a summary of the bindings it gives you.
	    ^X1 - ^X0  swap windows 1 to 10.
	    ^Xa        goes to the last window..
	    ^Xc ^X^C   creates a new window
	    ^Xk        kills the current window, and swaps it with a hidden window.
	    ^Xl        lists the windows.
	    ^Xn        swaps the next window (in refnumbers)
	    ^Xp        swap the previous window (in refnumbers)
	    ^X         (space) swap the next window.
	    ^XC        clears all windows visible

	  WINDOW
load service
	Usage: LOAD service
	  This script contains some aliases for the handling of
	  NickServ and NoteServ which are shortcuts for the
	  MSG NickServ|NoteServ <arguments>.
	
	  You have to setup a Variable which contains your NickServ-
	  Password with ASSIGN PASSWD password in your .ircrc.
	  When you then LOAD SERVICE that password will automatically
	  be sent to the NickServ.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  For NickServ :
	    .identify
	    .whois
	
	  For NoteServ :
	    .list   .tell (or .msg)
	    .read   .query
	    .away   .delete
	    .await  (or .waitfor)
load shell
	Usage: LOAD shell
	  This allows you to start a unix shell from inside IRC.  It 
	  requires that the ircflush program be available and so may
	  not work for everyone. The alias to start a shell will be
	  simply /shell.  This starts a shell in a new window. If the
	  ircflush program is not installed you will most likely see
	  now output until you close the shell.  (Which is of course
	  too late.)
load silent
	Usage: LOAD silent
	  A series of ON commands, which will make all of the *** join, leave,
	  signoff nickname and mode change messages disappear. Meant to be used
	  in high-traffic channels such as #report.
	
	  If you have %U somewhere in your STATUS_FORMAT variable, the messages
	  will appear in the status line instead, which is much less annoying,
	  than to have them in the ircII windows.
load smileys
	Usage: LOAD smileys
	  Contains a set of reverse smileys ready-to-use on keyboard
	  bindings. Silly but I couldn't chat without them..  ;)
	    META2-:, META2-(, META2-*, META2-I, META2-#, META2-;
load suggestions
	  If you have suggestions about the ircII script system, the scripts
	  themselves, or even have some contributions please send them to my address
	  for me to examine them and include them into distribution of ircII.
	  Consider also including help files for your scripts.
	
	  My address is:
	    mrgreen@mame.mu.oz.au (matthew green)
load tabkey
	Usage: LOAD tabkey
	  Here is the very widely used and useful script, tabkey, also known
	  as "the tabscript" or various other names.   When you send a message
	  to someone or receive a message it stores their name in a list.
	
	  You can pull up that person's name to send a message to them by 
	  pressing the TAB key, once or several time.  It's harder to explain
	  than to demonstrate.  /load the script, send a couple MSGs and 
	  then hit TAB a few times.  You'll get the idea.  Many people can't
	  live without this baby.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	  TAB        move forward through list.
	  ^R         move backwards through list.
	  ^X-^X      delete current name from the list
	  nicklist   show names currently on list.
	  addnick    add a nickname to the list manually
load time
	Usage: LOAD date
	  Will put the time, date, etc in the appropriate variables as 
	  recorded from the 'uptime' and 'date' commands in unix.
	  Variables are 'day', 'month', 'date', and 'time'.
load traces
	Usage: LOAD traces
	  Will reformat the way the output from TRACE appears totally.  
	  Cleans everything up considerably.
load troy
	Usage: LOAD troy
	  Troy's .ircrc file.   This has many very useful features such as the 
	  'TAB' feature and many other useful hints for aspiring ircII script coders.
load uhnotify
	Usage: LOAD uhnotify
	  This script adds userhost lookups for every nick on
	  the notify list.  It works much better with ircII
	  clients 2.3.13 or older.
load version
	Usage: LOAD version
	  This sets your CLIENT_INFORMATION variable to your client version.
	  This can be seen with CTCP <nick> VERSION.
load wallopstat
	Usage: LOAD wallopstat
	  Allows you to selectively ignore or not ignore certain types of 
	  wallops.  When loaded wallops are displayed normally.
	
	Additionnal commands available:
	    loud-	Make user wallops appear normally.
	    loud+	Make oper wallops appear normally.
	    loudS	Make server wallops appear normally.
	
	    silent-	Put user wallops in status line. 
	    silent+ 	Put oper wallops in status line.
	    silentS 	Put server wallops in status line.
load whowas
	Usage: LOAD whowas
	  Reduces the recursive whowas 'feature' of the server into a single 
	  response. 
load window
	Usage: LOAD window
	  This script contains bindings for Window handling in an EMACS-like
	  fashion. After pressing the META2 key (either CTRL-X or TAB) you
	  can press one of these:
	    2		Open a new window.
	    + or z	Grow the current window by one line.
	    - or ^z	Shrink the current window by one line.
	    =		Balance the size of all windows.
	    0		Kill the current window!
	    1		Kill all other windows!
locops
	See WALLOPS for more information about LOCOPS.
lusers
	Usage: LUSERS [<wildcard> [<server>]]
	  Gives a brief listing of the number of visible users, the
	  number of invisible users (marked UMODE +i), servers and
	  the number of operators.
	
	  Given a wildcard mask such as
	    LUSERS *.edu
	  it will count up the number of servers and users that match.
	  If you add a <server>, it'll be asked for the above information.
m
	See MSG for more information about M.
mb
	Usage: MB [<channel>] [<user@host>]
	  Mass bans all non-ops in the channel matching the user@host mask.
	  If no mask is given, *@* is used instead.

	  MODE
mdevoice
	Usage: MDEVOICE [<channel>] [<user@host>]
	  Takes away voice from all users matching the user@host mask. If no
	  mask is given, *@* is used.
	
	See Also:
	  MODE
mdv
	See MDEVOICE for more information about MDV.
me
	Usage: ME <action description>
	  or   <your_nickname> <action description>
	
	  This command can be used to send a description of what you are doing
	  or how you are feeling or just about anything concerning you, to the
	  current channel or query. When I type:
	    ME opens up the fridge
	  is supposed to produce a line on my talking partners'screens stating:
	    * Lynx opens up the fridge.
	
	  You can also use your own nickname as command, that is you can type the
	  line with a leading slash, like this:
	    lynx reaches out for the orange juice
	  Hopefully resulting into:
	    Lynx reaches out for the orange juice.
	
	  This command makes use of CTCP and is not understood by all IRC programs.
	  If you get an error message, your description has not arrived properly.

menus
	This describes a feature which allows one to create and use
	menus in any irc session.  The menus are totally user
	configurable and a test menu has been provided at the end
	of this help file.
	To use this menu, copy it to your home directory calling it
	'test', run IRC, and do the following:
	  MLOAD test
	  SET menu Main Menu
	
	Control-R is bound to ENTER_MENU, and while in the menu
	you can use vi-like keys or EMACS-like keys to move
	through the options, and either '.' or SPACE to select
	an option. The format of the menu file is as follows
	
	A line beginning with a '#' represents a comment.
	Blank lines are ignored.
	A line beginning with the word "MENU" starts a new menu
	and gives it a name.
	A line beginning with the word "OPTION" adds a new option
	to the menu, gives it a name and describes what it does.
	It's possible to have one menu OPTION lead you into a new menu with
	  OPTION "Sub Menu" COMMAND set menu Sub Menu
	assuming the Sub Menu has been defined like the following Main Menu.
	
	The following is a test menu to show how it it can be used.
	
	# Cut off this line.. and take everything down to the next Cut line ---
	# Test menu to see how our menu reader works
	
	MENU Main Menu
		OPTION "This menu" MENU Main Menu
		OPTION "List Channels" COMMAND LIST
		OPTION "Join Channel" COMMAND JOIN $"Join Channel: "
		OPTION "Leave Channel" COMMAND PART *
		OPTION "Change Name" COMMAND NICK $"New NickName: "
		OPTION "Private Message" COMMAND MSG $"Person to send message to: " $"Text of message: "
		OPTION "Say something" COMMAND SAY $"Say: "
		OPTION "Exit Menu" EXIT
		OPTION "Exit IRC" COMMAND if ( [$"Really quit? "] == [y] ) { QUIT }
		OPTION "Kill Menu" COMMAND set -menu

	  KICK
mkb
	Usage: MKB [<timeout>] [<channel>] <user@host> [<reason>]
	  Mass kicks and bans all non-ops matching the user@host mask.
	
	  If a timeout value is entered, the ban will be removed after that
	  many number of minutes.

mode
	Usage: MODE *|<channel> [+|-]<modechars> [<parameters>]
	       MODE *|<channel> [+|-]b [<nick>[!<user>[@<host>]]]
	       MODE <nick> [+|-]<umodechars>
	
	  Mode command is quite complicated and it allows channel
	  operators to change channel mode, or any user to change
	  their personal mode. For a channel mode, <modechars> is one of 
	  the following:
	    i           - channel is invite only
	    k <key>     - Adds join key <key> to the channel.  Keys can added or
			  removed (MODE <channel> -k <key>), but not changed.
	    l <number>  - channel is limited, where <number> is the
	                  maximum number of users allowed
	    m           - channel is moderated (only channel operators talk)
	    n           - No MSGs to the channel are allowed
			  from someone outside the channel.
	    o <nick>    - Makes <nick> a channel operator
	    p           - channel is private
	    s           - channel is secret
	                  Note: On 2.8 servers you cannot set both +p and +s modes
	    t           - topic limits, only the channel operators may change it
	    v <nick>    - Gives someone a voice to talk on a moderated channel. 
	
	  A + or - sign determines whether the specified mode should be
	  added or deleted.
	  If you supply * as channel name, modes will apply to your current channel.
	
	  The second form of the MODE command allows you to ban
	  somebody from a channel. This is done by specifying
	  a sting of the form nick!user@host. For example:
	    MODE #MyChannel +b *!*@gus.*
	  bans everybody from the channel who is on IRC from any
	  machine whose name is gus.
	    MODE #MyChannel +b netw1z
	  bans anybody using the nickname netw1z.
	    MODE #MyChannel +b *!merklin@*
	  bans anybody whose user name is merklin.
	    MODE #MyChannel +b jerk!tug@boat.edu
	  bans the user tug@boat.edu from the channel whenever he
	  is using the nickname "jerk".
	
	  If you are channel operator, you can list the bans in effect on a channel:
	    MODE #MyCHannel b
	
	  The third form of the MODE command allows you to modify your
	  personal parameters. You can precede any combination of the
	  following with + or - (+to switch that mode on, - to switch it off).
	
	    o        - IRC operator status. You may not turn this on
	               with mode. To assert operator status, you must use OPER
	    w        - Receive WALLOPS (messages directed at all operators.
	               see WALLOPS.
	    s        - Receive server notices. This includes KILL notices
	               and notices about what is happening with links
	               to the local server.
	    i        - Render yourself invisible. This prevents you from
	               being seen in WHO and WHOIS information, unless
	               somebody specifies your exact nickname with WHOIS.
	
	Note:
	  Attempting to avoid a ban placed on you  may result in
	  forcible removal from IRC or being banned from your server.
mop
	Usage: MOP [<channel>] [<user@host>]
	  Mass ops all non-ops matching the user@host mask. If no mask is
	  given, *@* is used.
	
	See Also:
	  MODE
motd
	Usage: MOTD [<server>|<nickname>]
	  Gives the message-of-the-day for the named server.  If no
	  server is given, your server is used. If a nickname is 
	  given it queries the server that that person is currently
	  using.  You should be sure to check the MOTD regularly.
	  Ignorance of the law is not a defense in any court in the
	  land.
msg
	Usage: MSG <nicknames>|<channel>|%<pid>|=<nick>|@<user>|<n>|<command> <text>
	  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
	  specified.  A list of nicknames should by separated by commas
	  (no spaces).  Three special case nicknames are defined.  If the
	  nickname is "," (a comma), the message is sent to the last
	  person who sent you a MSG.  If the nickname is "."  (a
	  period), the message is sent to the last person to whom you
	  sent a message.  If the nickname is "*" the message is send to
	  the current channel.
	
	  The second form allows you to specify a channel name to which
	  to send the message.  The message will go to everyone on that
	  channel.
	
	  The third form specifies an EXEC process id to send output to.
	
	  The fourth form allows you to specify a DCC CHAT connection over
	  which to send the message. The nick specifies the nickname under
	  which the connection was established.
	
	  The fifth form allows you to specify a DCC TALK connection over
	  which to send the message. The user specifies the user part of
	  the user@host used to establish the DCC TALK connection.
	
	  The sixth form lets you specify a process number to which the
	  message will go, where n is the process number.  This works
	  just like the EXEC -IN command.  For example:
	    MSG %1 Homina homina homina
	  will send the text to process 1.  Process 1 must be running
	  already using a previous call to EXEC.
	    
	  The last form allows messages of the type MSG COMMAND <message>
	  which allows you to send a message to some command.  Try MSG /ECHO blue
	  This is meant to be used with QUERY primarily.
	
	*  There is also a use of wildcards for operators.
	*    MSG $*.edu
	*  will address all users having .edu in their serverinfo.
	*    MSG #*.edu
	*  will address all users having .edu at the end of their host name.

	  only information only about your current channel.  The displayed
	  list may also be limited by using one or more of the
	  following flags:

	  about flag settings, and HELP LS for info about time.
note save
	*Usage: NOTE SAVE
	*  SAVE saves all messages with the save flag set. Notice that the

note spy
	Usage: NOTE SPY [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
			<nick!username@host> [msg]
	  SPY is an alias for USER +RX (default 1 max day)
	  SPY makes the server tell you if any matching recipient sign(s)
	  on/off IRC or change nick name. No message needs to be specified.
	  However, if a message is specified this is returned to sender including
	  with the message about recipient. Message could for example be one or
	  more Ctrl-G characters to activate the bell on senders machine.
	  As an alternative for using C flag, <msg> field could start with
	  any number of nicks on this format: %nick1 %nick2... %nickn, with
	  no space between % and the nick name you use. Spy messages would be
	  valid for any of the nicks specified.
	  SPY with no argument would tell you what users you have spy on who are 
	  currently on IRC. The system logs last time the last matching person was 
	  on IRC for each SPY request is queued in the server. See NOTE LOG for this.
	  You may use flag +A to see what server matching user is on, 
	  and/or +J flag to see what channel. (Read HELP NOTE USER for more). Example:
	    SPY foobar!username@host <ctrl-G>
	    SPY +10 foobar
	    SPY +aj &secret * <ctrl-G>
	    SPY +365 +e !user nick!*@* <ctrl-G>

	*Usage: NOTE STATS [MSM|MSW|MUM|MUW|MST|MSF|USED|RESET] [value]
	  STATS with no option displays the values of the following variables:
	    MSM: Max number of server messages.
	    MSW: Max number of server messages with username-wildcards.
	    MUM: Max number of user messages.
	    MUW: Max number of user messages with username-wildcards.
	    MST: Max server time.
	    MSF: Note save frequency (checks for save only when an user register)
	  Notice that 'dynamic' mark after MSM means that if there are more
	  messages in the server than MSM, the current number of messages are
	  displayed instead of MSM.
	  Only one of this variables are displayed if specified.
	*  You can change any of the stats by specifying new value after it.
	*  RESET sets the stats to the same values which is set when starting the
	*  server daemon if no note file exist. Notice that this stats are saved
	*  in same file as the other messages.
note user
	Usage: NOTE USER [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
			<nick!username@host> <msg>
	  With USER you can queue a message in the server, and when the recipient
	  signs on/off IRC, change nick or join any channel, note checks for
	  valid messages. This works even if the sender is not on IRC. See HELP
	  FLAGS for more info. 
	  Password can be up to ten characters long. You may specify password 
	  using the &, % or $ character. & is equal to to $, except working much
	  better cause client use $ for other things...
	  The % character works like &, except it makes the queuing silent. It
	  makess also sense to use this without any following password.
	  If any request queued is equal to any previous except time and maxtime,
	  only maxtime is changed as specified. You then get "Joined" instead of
	  "Queued". 
	  HELP FLAGS for info about flag settings. Username can be specified
	  without @host. Do not use wildcards in username if you know what it
	  is, even if it's possible. Max time before the server automatically
	  remove the message from the queue, is specified with hours with a
	  '-' character first, or days if a '+' character is specified, as
	  -5 hours, or +10 days. Default maxtime is 7 days.
	  Note: The received message is *directly* displayed on the screen,
	  without the need for a read or remove request.
	    NOTE USER &secret +WN +10 Wizible!jarlek@ifi.uio.no Howdy!
	  is an example of a message sent only to the specified recipient if
	  this person is an operator, and after receiving the message, the server
	  sends a note message back to sender to inform about the delivery.
	    NOTE USER +XR -5 Anybody <ctrl-G>
	  is an example which makes the server to tell when Anybody signs
	  on/off irc, change nick etc. This process repeats for 5 hours.
	    NOTE USER +FL @*.edu *account*
	  is an example which makes the server send a message back if any real-
	  name of any user matches *account*. Message is sent back as note from
	  server, or directly as a notice if sender is on IRC at this time.

	  WAITFOR is an alias for USER +YD (default max 1 day)
	  Default message is [Waiting]
	  This command is for telling the recipient if this appears on IRC that
	  you are waiting for him/her and notice that this got that message. Example:
	    WAITFOR foobar
	    WAITFOR -2 foobar!username@*
	    WAITFOR foobar Waiting for you until pm3:00..
note wall
	*Usage: NOTE WALL [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
	*			<nick!user@host> <msg>
	*  WALL is an alias for USER +BR (default max 1 day)
	*  This command is for sending a message once to every matching user
	*  on IRC. Be careful using this command. WALL creates a list of 
	*  persons received the message (and should not have it once more time)
	*  with H flag set. This list can be displayed using ls +h from the
	*  nick and username@host which the WALL request is queued from.
	*  Removing the headers (H) before WALL request is removed would cause
	*  the message to be sent once more to what users specified in list.
	*  WALL +7 @*.edu Do not do this! - Makes it clear for all users using 
	*  IRC on host @*.edu the next 7 days how stupid it is to send such WALL's ;) 
note wallops
	*Usage: NOTE WALLOPS [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
	*		<nick!user@host> <msg>
	*  WALLOPS is an alias for USER +BRW (default max 1 day)
	*  This command is same as WALL, except only opers could receive it.
notice
	Usage: NOTICE <nickname>|<channel> <text of message>
	  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
	  specified.  Unlike MSG, no automated response messages (such as
	  generated by IGNORE or an automaton) will be sent in response
	  to a NOTICE.  Other than that, it's just like a MSG.
	
	See Also:
	  MSG for a description of parameters and switches.
notify
	Usage: NOTIFY [[-]<nickname> [[-]<nickname> ...]]
	  Use of this command lets you mark certain nicknames such that
	  you will be warned when they signon or off of IRC.  When
	  someone on your notify-list signs on, you will see a message
	    *** Signon by <nickname> detected
	  Likewise, when they signoff, you will see
	    *** Signoff by <nickname> detected
	  Someone will be shown as signed off if they change nicknames as well,
	  so keep this in mind.
	
	  You can modify how the signon and signoff messages are
	  displayed using the ON NOTIFY_SIGNON and ON NOTIFY_SIGNOFF
	  commands.
	
	  Specifying a - before a nickname will remove notification
	  checking for that nickname.  If no parameters are specified,
	  the current status of each user on your notify list is
	  displayed.  If you specify a + without any additional
	  parameters:
	    NOTIFY +
	  you will be shown a list of only those people on your
	  notification list who are currently on irc.  If you specify
	  a - with no additional parameters, all nicks will be removed.

on action
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]ACTION [-|^]<paramters> <action>
	  This is activated whenever you receive an ACTION from someone.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who sent the ACTION
	    $1    to whom (nickname or channel) the ACTION was sent
	    $2-   The message
on channel_nick
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]CHANNEL_NICK [-|^]"<channel> [<nick>]" [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone on a channel you are on
	  changes their nickname. The parameters for this function are:
	    $0  The channel from which that person has changed nick
	    $1  Original nickname for that person
	    $2	New nickname for that person
on channel_signoff
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]CHANNEL_SIGNOFF [-|^]"<channel> [<nick>]" [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone on a channel you are on
	  leaves irc.  Normally, the display would show:
	    *** Signoff: <nickname>
	  but, of course, you can change this.  If <nick> is your own
	  nickname, then the action will be taken when you exit
	  from irc.  The parameters are as follows:
	    $0  The channel from which the person signed off
	    $1  Nickname of person who left irc
	    $2- Text of Signoff message. 
on connect
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]CONNECT [-|^]<server> <port> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a connect to a server.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    The name of the server you connected to.
	    $1    The port number you connected to.
on ctcp
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]CTCP [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This event is activated whenever someone sends a client-to-client
	  protocol (CTCP) request.  Certain CTCP types are have predefined
	  actions that you can't override with the ^, but you can use the
	  to create your own CTCP protocols.  The parameters are:
	        $0      nick of person who send CTCP
	        $1      who the ctcp was to (either your nick or a channel)
	        $2      The CTCP command word
	        $3-     Any additional arguments
	  For example, if you want to set up a new ctcp function called 
	  CHEESE, you  would do:
	    ON -CTCP "* * CHEESE" CTCP $0 $2 Say Cheese!
	  Using the /CTCP in an ON CTCP automatically sends the proper 
	  reply format.  If someone no send you a:
	    CTCP <yournick> CHEESE
	  you will see:
	    *** CTCP CHEESE from <theirnick>:
	  and they will see:
	    *** CTCP REPLY CHEESE from <yournick>: Say Cheese!
	  
	See Also:
	  CTCP
	  ON CTCP_REPLY
on ctcp_reply
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]CTCP_REPLY [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This event is activated when you receive a reply from a CTCP
	  request that you made (with the CTCP command).  For example,
	  if you did:
	    CTCP BigCheese VERSION
	  you would receive a:
	    *** CTCP REPLY VERSION from BigCheese: IRCII 2.1beta2 Unix
	  from BigCheese.  However, if you had:
	    ON ^CTCP_REPLY "* VERSION" /echo $0 is using $2-
	  and did the CTCP show above, you would get something like:
	    BigCheese is using IRCII 2.1beta2 Unix
	  The parameters are:
		$0	nick of person who sent the reply
		$1	The CTCP command being replied to
		$2-	The reply itself (depends on $1)
	  Note: You may NOT use the CTCP command in an ON CTCP_REPLY.  
	  It simply will report an error message to you and not work.  
	  It is illegal to do this and it is not supported.
on dcc_chat
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]DCC_CHAT [-|^]<paramters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a DMSG from someone.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who sent the DMSG
	    $1-   The message
	
	  Warning: As DMSG is outside the IRC protocol, it allows you to send
	  a DMSG from an ON DCC_CHAT. This has the potential to create loops.
	  If you intend to send a DMSG from DCC_CHAT you are responsible for
	  ensuring that it will not create a loop.
on dcc_raw
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]DCC_RAW [-|^]<paramters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a raw message from 
	  a tcp connection established with $CONNECT().
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    file descriptor for the connection.
	    $1    host name in connection
	    $2    code as listed below
	    $3-   data or port number depending on code. 
	
	  Incoming messages can be intercepted with ON DCC_RAW,
	  which has the following formats:
	
	          fd host D data
	          fd host C
	          fd host N port
	          fd host E port
	
	  The D message indicated incoming data.
	  The C message indicates that the socket has been closed.
	  The N message indicates that a socket listening on the
	  specified port has accepted a connection. fd in this case
	  is the file descriptor for the new connection.
	  The E message is generated when a CONNECT() results in a
	  successful connection.
	
	  Conventions to be used for the socket access:
	
	          Scripts using sockets should never use the
	          serial number 0 in their hooks. As their first
	          act before using the DCC_RAW hooks, they should
	          set:
	
	          ON ^DCC_RAW * #
	
	          To ensure that all raw DCC sockets produce no
	          output.
	
	          A new set of hooks should be created for each
	          active socket at a chosen serial number. One
	          must always exist to detect the close message,
	          and as its last act must remove all the hooks
	          for that file descriptor.

on disconnect
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]DISCONNECT [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you are disconnected from an
	  irc server and IRCII's automatic reconnection techniques
	  can't get you reconnected.  This would be any situation
	  which you would see
	    *** Use /SERVER to connect to a server
	  Parameters:
		$0	Last server you were connected to
on exec
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]EXEC [-|^]<paramters> [action]
	  This is activate whenever an EXEC'd process produces output
	  to its standard output channel.  The process number is the
	  number assigned by EXEC to the process (see HELP EXEC).  The
	  parameters to this function are:
	    $0	The process number that activated the ON
		If the EXEC was called with EXEC -name <process name>
		then $0 matches this name instead. This is very useful
		for keeping the processes separated out.
	    $1-	The line of output to stdout
on exec_errors
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]EXEC_ERRORS [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activate whenever an EXEC'd process produces output
	  to its standard error channel.  The process number is the
	  number assigned by EXEC to the process (see HELP EXEC).  The
	  parameters to this function are:
	    $0  The process number that activated the ON
		This may also use the process name.  (See ON EXEC)
	    $1- The line of output to stderr
on exec_exit
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]EXEC_EXIT [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated when any EXEC'd process exits.  The parameters
	  are:
		$0	Process number or logical name (if assigned)
		$1	Signal that killed the process (or 0 if it exited normally)
		$2	Exit code for process (non-zero only if $1 is 0)
on exec_prompt
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]EXEC_PROMPT [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever an EXEC'd process displays a 
	  "prompt".  A "prompt" is defined as any line of output from
	  a process that doesn't end in a carriage return - line feed.
	  The parameters are:
		$0	process number or logical name (if assigned)
		$1	The prompt string
on flood
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]FLOOD [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  The FLOOD type is activated whenever someone sends a lot of 
	  information very rapidly to you, your channel, or the system at 
	  large (ie: a wallop).  Usually, this is caused when someone dumps
	  a file to your channel or to you.  The parameters for this are:
	    $0	The nick of the flooder
	    $1	The type of flooding being done 
	    $2  The target of the flooder
	    $3- The content of the flooding message
	
	  General use for ON FLOOD is as follows:
	    ON ^FLOOD *
	  This will automatically prevent flooding messages from being 
	  displayed and automatically disable itself when the flooding
	  has stopped.
	
	  If you use services like IRCIIHelp or NickServ, these can appear to
	  IRCII as floods, but if you add to following ON lines:
	    ON FLOOD ^IRCIIHelp
	    ON FLOOD ^NickServ
	  These will not be treated as floods and will let their messages through.
	
	  Warning:  There are occasions where ON FLOOD can be inadvertantly 
	  activated (such as after a net-burp, or after you have ^Z'd for a
	  while).  Therefore, I strongly advise against using KILL or even
	  KICK as the action taken by an ON FLOOD.

on help
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]HELP [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  ON HELP is activated for each line of the HELP command 
	  that is displayed.  There is probably no other use 
	  for this except by IRCIIHelp.  So ignore it.
on hook
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^]HOOK [-|^]<any pattern> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a HOOK.  HOOKs are generated
	  by the user for one purpose, which is to activate ON HOOK.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
		$0   First word of text
		$1   Second word of text..
		$2-  Rest of pattern.   Can use whatever you like.
	  Basically if you have an ON HOOK pattern   and you send a HOOK command
	  that matches the pattern it will be activated.  This is useful for
	  testing ON patterns, and sending commands from within scripts and 
	  aliases which can be either ignored or acted upon (ON HOOK).

on idle
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]IDLE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated when IRCII has been idle for a period of
	  time.  Idleness is in minutes from the last keystroke.
	  Parameters:
	        $0       minutes idletime
	
	  So, ON IDLE 5 /ECHO FINISHED will print out "FINISHED"
	  after a period of 5 minutes without any key pressed.
on input
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]INPUT [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you send a line of input to either
	  a channel or a query user.  This means that if you type in a
	  message and hit return, ON INPUT can be activated.
	  ON INPUT can catch and process any input line.
	
	Note: The fact that you can capture any line and suppress further
	  normal processing means you can completely disable the client
	  by accident or on purpose.  Don't use this function if you don't
	  know exactly what you are trying to do.
	  Parameters are:
		$0	Text of line
	  If you use ^ to suppress the processing of the line, you can 
	  do your own pre-processing and send the line back to the client 
	  with a call to SENDLINE.
	  Note $[1]0 is the first character of the first word of the line.
	  Also, the $T var can show you who or what you're talking to at
	  any given moment.

on invite
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]INVITE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive an INVITE.  The
	  parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who invited you
	    $1    the channel to which you are being invited
on join
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]JOIN [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone joins a channel you are on.  
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who joined the channel
	    $1    the channel which was joined
on kick
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]KICK [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone kicks someone else from a
	  channel.  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who kicked
	    $1    the nickname of the person being kicked
	    $2    the channel the person is being kicked from
	    $3-   the kick comment
on leave
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]LEAVE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone leaves a channel you are on.  
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who left the channel
	    $1    the channel which which was left
	    $2    the optional part message
on list
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]LIST [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  When LIST is activated any outputline will be modified
	  by [action].
	  For example:
	    ON LIST "* 5 *" /ECHO NUMBER OF USERS: 5
	  
	  The parameters are as follows:
	    $0    channel name
	    $1    number of users on channel
	    $2-   topic of channel
on mail
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]MAIL [-|^]<count> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive new mail (non-irc mail)
	  or when you start up irc and you have mail.  You can use this
	  to replace the standard "*** You have new mail" banner with
	  anything you like.  The parameters for this function are:
	    $0  The number of new mail messages
	    $1  Total number of mail messages
	  On startup, new mail messages will be all messages found.
	  After that, for example if you had 2 messages and a new
	  message came in, new messages would be 1.  Here are a few
	  examples of how to use this:
	    ON ^MAIL 1 /echo *** You have $0 new mail message, total of $1
	    ON ^MAIL * /echo *** You have $0 new mail messages, total of $1
	  These will display the number of new messages that arrive.
	  Here is another example:
	    ON ^MAIL * /comment
	  This will disable the display of any message when you have
	  mail.  Setting the MAIL variable to OFF will also have this
	  effect, but this will also disable the total mail messages
	  count in the status line.
on mode
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]MODE_CHANGE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone on a channel you are on
	  changes the mode for that channel (see HELP MODE).  The 
	  parameters for this function are:
	    $0  The nickname of the person who changed the mode
	    $1	The channel on which the mode was changed
	    $2- The new mode settings for that channel
on msg
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]MSG [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a MSG from someone.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who sent the MSG
	    $1-   The message
	
	  Warning: If you attempt to send a MSG from within a MSG
	  action, it will be automatically converted to a NOTICE, as
	  this will prevent MSG loops from being sent between two or
	  more users.  Also, you will not be permitted to send either
	  MSGs or NOTICEs from within a NOTICE action.  The irc protocol
	  states that NOTICEs may not generate automatic replies so this 
	  will prevent loops of automatic messages from flooding the net.
on msg_group
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]MSG_GROUP [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a message sent to a
	  "group" of people, such as a message from an operator to 
	  everyone on a given server.  
	  Parameters:
	        $0      Sender
	        $1      Group being sent to
	        $2-     Text of message
on names
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NAMES [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  When NAMES is activated any outputline will be modified
	  by [action].
	  For example:
	    ON NAMES * /echo $0 $1-
	
	  The parameters are as follows:
	    $0    name of the channel
	    $1    all users on this channel
on nickname
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NICKNAME [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone on a channel you are on
	  changes their nickname. The parameters for this function are:
	    $0  Original nickname for that person
	    $1	New nickname for that person
on note
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NOTE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive an irc NOTE.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who sent the note
	    $1    The user@hostname of the person who sent the note
	    $2    The note flags (see HELP NOTE FLAGS)
	    $3-7  The time the note was queued.
	    $8    The server from which the note was queued
	    $9-   The message itself
on notice
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NOTICE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a NOTICE from someone.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    nickname of person who sent the NOTICE
	    $1-   The message
	
	  Warning: If you attempt to send a MSG from within a MSG
	  action, it will be automatically converted to a NOTICE, as
	  this will prevent MSG loops from being sent between two or
	  more users.  Also, you will not be permitted to send either
	  MSGs or NOTICEs from within a NOTICE action.  The irc protocol
	  states that NOTICEs may not generate automatic replies so this 
	  will prevent loops of automatic messages from flooding the net.
on notify_signoff
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NOTIFY_SIGNOFF [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated when someone on your notify list (see
	  NOTIFY) signs off of irc.  The parameters to the action are:
	    $0  Nickname of person who signed off
on notify_signon
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]NOTIFY_SIGNON [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated when someone on your notify list (see
	  NOTIFY) signs onto irc.  The parameters to the action are:
	    $0  Nickname of person who signed on
on numeric
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]<numeric> [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever a numeric message of that number arrives.
	  The legal range of values for <numeric> are from 001 to 999.
	  Numeric messages are special replies send by the server to the client
	  in the raw irc protocol.  They are useful to intercept if you are 
	  writing a service using ircII.  For more details about what numbers
	  represent what messages from the server, please see the irc server
	  source code.  
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    name of the server who sent the message
	    $1    number of numeric message
	    $2-   parameters (depends on the numeric message)

on
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]<event> [serial] [-|^]<match> [action]
	  The ON command lets you set up actions which will occur when
	  certains events happen.  For example, you can create
	  "personalized" away messages for different individuals,
	  periodic actions that occur at specific times, just to name
	  a few.
	
	  Note that using ON JOIN and ON LEAVE to automatically greet
	  people entering or leaving your channel is extremely poor
	  etiquette. See /HELP ETIQUETTE.
	
	ON [mode]<event> [-|^]<match> [action]
	ON [mode]#<event> <serial number> [-|^]<match> [action]
	
	  There are seven modes for each event.  I've shown the # mode
	  as a separate line because it requires a serial number.
	  Different modes are specified by preceeding the event with
	  one of the following characters:
	    +           Make event very noisy.  It will display
	                everything it does.
	    -           Make event quiet.  It will not display any of
	                it's actions.
	    ^           Make event silent.  Just like - above except it
	                inhibits the normal event display as well.  The
	                only command that will cause output in this mode
	                is the ECHO command.  This can be used to redefine 
	                how event messages look.
	    &		Make the /ON local to only your own server.  e.g.
			/on -&msg * echo One of mine
			Will echo "One of mine" ONLY when someone from my own
			current server sends me a message.  If nothing matches
			in this list, then it will resort to the default ONs.
			Of if there was an /ON ^msg * echo :$0: $1- then it 
	 		it will use that for anyone not on your server.
	    @ 		This is like & except that it is exclusive to your
			server.  It will NOT look at the default ONs if 
			there is no match for your own server.
	    #           Allows you to assign a serial number to the specific
			<event> such that you can have multiple ON's trigger
			of one <event>.  Further discussion of this below.
	 		Note this is a pound sign NOT a number. The serial
			number comes right after the <event>.
	  If no character is specified, you will be warned upon activation 
	  of an event (this is somewhere between the + and - modes).
	
	  The <match> parameter may be a single word, or a list of words 
	  surrounded by double quotes (").  The <match> determines 
	  specifically which events of the given <event> will cause 
	  the action to take place.  The <match> may contain wildcards,
	  and the specifics of the <match> parameter are dependant on
	  the <event> type.  
	  
	  If the <match> is preceeded by a -, that entry will be
	  removed from the action list.  For example:
	    ON PUBLIC -BigCheese
	    ON INVITE  -"* +Har"
	  The first will remove "BigCheese" from the PUBLIC list, the second will
	  remove -"* +Har" from the INVITE list.
	  You can remove all entries from a given event list by doing
	  the following:
	    ON <event> -
	  For example:
	    ON MSG -
	  removes all entries in the ON MSG list.
	
	  If the <match> is preceeded by a ^, then no action will be taken
	  for a match for that event (this is used when you wish
	  to exclude a nickname or list of nicknames from a larger
	  wildcard match, see HELP ON FLOOD for an example).  
	
	  Added two new wildcards to the pattern matching system.
	  '%' matches any sequence of characters except a space.
	  '?' matches any single character.
	  e.g.  ON ^msg "bob % % blue" whatever
	  would match a message from bob with two words and then the word
	  'blue'.
	 
	  The [action] parameter is that action that will occur when the
	  specified event occurs which matches the given <match>.
	  The action parameter is parsed by the command parse in exactly
	  the same way as an IRCII alias is parsed, using the same inline
	  variable expansions (See ALIAS).  Also, depending on the
	  event that is activated, there will be certain values passed
	  as arguments to the action, just as if they were arguments to
	  an alias.  You may use the $0, $1, $2... etc variables to
	  expand out these arguments.  The arguments passed for each
	  event are described in the individual help files for each event.
	
	  Here are some examples:
	    ON -MSG *cheese* /NOTICE $0 No Cheese Messages Please!
	  Whenver a MSG is received from anyone with a nickname with
	  cheese in it, a NOTICE will be sent out to that user.  This
	  action will generate no noticeable effect to you (it is marked
	  as "quiet").
	
	    ON MSG ^BigCheese
	  If used with the first example above, this will prevent the
	  action from being taken when a message is sent from BigCheese.
	
	  Here is an example of how to redefine the way a
	  message looks:
	    ON ^MSG * /ECHO :$0: $1-
	  All MSGs received from now on will look:
	
	  :BigCheese: Hello!
	  The same can be done with the other event types.
	
	IMPORTANT IMPORTANT: A full discussion of serial numbers is
	  given in HELP ON serial_numbers as there is too 
	  much to place directly in this help file. Please read this one
	  as it will help prevent collisions between different scripts.
	
	  More examples are given for the individual event types.

on serial_numbers
	How to use SERIAL NUMBERS
	  This describes the use of serial numbers in ON functions, 
	  and is a direct extension of the basic ON help file.
	
	  It is now possible to have more than one ON hook executed for
	  each event triggering a hook. This has been done by adding a
	  new serial number concept to the ON command. Each ON hook has
	  a serial number attached. Serial numbers can be any number
	  from -maxint to maxint, with the default being 0.
	
	  When an event triggers a hook, IRCII now goes through the ON
	  hooks added for that event, and for each serial number used
	  by ON hooks in that hook type, finds the best match out of those
	  ON hooks which have that serial number and executes that ON
	  hook. The hooks are executed in order of serial number. Thus
	  if you set up the following set of MSG hooks.
	
	          ON #^MSG -666 * echo Message coming:
	          ON ^MSG * echo Message from $0: $1-
	          ON #^MSG 666 * echo I got one, I got one!
	          ON #^MSG 666 WiZ echo WiZ hath spoken
	
	  will cause the following to appear when you receive a message:
	
	          Message coming:
	          Message from nick: text
	          I got one, I got one!
	
	  And the following if you receive a message from WiZ:
	
	          Message coming:
	          Message from WiZ: text
	          WiZ hath spoken
	
	  The default serial number is 0, and the serial numbers are always
	  executed in order, starting with the lowest, and ending with the
	  highest.
	
	  Although the '^' modifier can be used with any serial number,
	  it will only suppress the default action if used with serial
	  number 0. Thus if the only message hook you have is:
	
	          ON #^MSG -666 * echo Incoming:
	
	  You will see the following when you receive a message:
	
	          Incoming:
	          *nick* text
	
	  It is advisable to place any ON hooks which do not suppress the
	  default action in a serial number other than 0. In particular,
	  TIMER hooks, which are generally not intended to exclude other
	  TIMER hooks, should be placed at different serial numbers wherever
	  possible, and never on 0 (since 0 is the most likely place to
	  get a clash if anybody does use it).

on server_notice
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]SERVER_NOTICE [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever you receive a message from the server
	  as a NOTICE. This is basically anything beginning with "***" which
	  is sent to you by the server, and the MOTD.
	
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    The name of the server which sent you the message
	    $1    The first word of the text sent - probably "***" or "MOTD"
	    $2-   The message
on signoff
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]SIGNOFF [-|^]<parameters> [action]
	  This is activated whenever someone on a channel you are on
	  leaves irc.  Normally, the display would show:
	    *** Signoff: <nickname> (<reason>)
	  but, of course, you can change this.  If <nick> is your own
	  nickname, then the action will be taken when you exit
	  from irc.  The parameters are as follows:
	    $0  Nickname of person who left irc
	    $1- Reason for the sign-off.
on talk
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]TALK [-|^]<user> [action]

	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    user name of person who sent the TALK message
	    $1-   The message
on timer
	Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]TIMER [-|^]<time> [action]
	  This is activated whenever the real-time clock is equal to the
	  time specification you gave it.  The time specifications should
	  be one of two forms:
		HH:MM[AM|PM]	where 1<=HH<=12 and 0<=MM<=59
		HH:MM		where 0<=HH<=23 and 0<=MM<=59
	  which form you use depends on the current setting of
	  CLOCK_24HOUR.  Time specification may include wildcards as
	  well.  The matching of the real-time clock and the time
	  specification is a pure textual match.  Of course, wildcards
	  may be used in the time specification.
	  The parameters for the action are as follows:
	    $0    The time (format depends on CLOCK_24HOUR variable)

parsekey
	Usage: PARSEKEY <key function>
	  The argument is one of the key functions, and the effect is the
	  same as would be if you pressed a key bound to that function.
	  These are the same functions as specififed when using BIND.  E.g.
	    PARSEKEY ERASE_TO_BEG_OF_LINE   will execute that function

	See LEAVE for more information about PART.
ping
	Usage: PING [<nickname>]
	  This command will send a CTCP PING <current time> to the given
	  nickname or nicknames.  The remote client will bounce the time
	  back and that is compared with the new current time.  The
	  difference in the two times, is how long it takes for a message
	  to get to that person and get back.  This should give you some
	  idea of how slow or fast the network is.  Do not use with too
	  long a list of nicknames or server flood control will kick in
	  and the return times will be inaccurate.
	
	  If no nickname is given, the query will be sent to the current
	  channel.

query
	Usage: QUERY [<nicknames>|%n|/<command>]
	  Starts a private conversation with <nicknames>.  All text you
	  type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to
	  <nicknames> in the form of MSGs.  To cancel a private
	  conversation, use QUERY with no arguments.  The %n arguments
	  allows you to send the query text to a process number n.  The
	  process must have already been started using a previous call
	  to EXEC.  It's also possible to query someone on a
	  DCC connection with  QUERY =nickname.
	  Another form has been added which allows you to send messages to
	  the specified command with the format QUERY /COMMAND
	  and everything you type will be parsed by that /command.  Can be
	  an alias or anything you like. Note that when querying a command,
	  you may need to use XECHO -WINDOW to ensure output goes to the 
	  right place.
	  If "*" is given as a nickname the output is sent to the current
	  channel.

	  EXEC
	  DCC QUERY
queue
	Usage: QUEUE [<switch>] [ [<name>] [ ... ] ]
	  This command manages queues for future batch processing.
	
	  If no switches are provided, the command adds an item to a queue.
	  Note that the item must be enclosed in { } brackets to be added.
	  For example:
	
	    /QUEUE qname { echo This is an item in a queue. }
	
	  To run the contents of a queue, use the -DO switch with the name
	  of the queue.  Note that the named queue will be removed after it
	  is run.
	
	    /QUEUE -DO qname
	
	  To run the contents of a queue without removing it afterwards, use
	  the -NO_FLUSH switch:
	
	    /QUEUE -NO_FLUSH qname
	
	  To view the contents of a queue, use the -LIST switch with the
	  name of the queue:
	
	    /QUEUE -LIST qname
	
	  To view all queues, use the -SHOW switch:
	
	    /QUEUE -SHOW
	
	  To remove an item from a queue, use the -DELETE switch with the
	  the name of the queue and the item number:
	
	    /QUEUE -DELETE qname 1
	
	  To completely remove an entire queue, use the -FLUSH switch with
	  the name of the queue:
	
	    /QUEUE -FLUSH qname

quit
	Usage: QUIT [<reason>]
	  Quits your IRC session. If a reason is supplied, it is displayed
	  to other people on your channels.
	  BYE, EXIT and SIGNOFF are identical.
quote
	Usage: QUOTE <server command>
	  Send a command directly to the server.  No parsing is done by
	  the client.
rbind
	Usage: RBIND <function>
	  Returns the keys bound to function.
rchat
	Usage: RCHAT NICK
	  This is the same as using DCC CLOSE CHAT NICK.
	
	See Also:
	  DCC CLOSE
	  MSG
redirect
	Usage: REDIRECT <nick|channel|process|=nick> <cmd>
	  This will send the output from the given command to the
	  specified nickname, channel, or started process.  For 
	  example: 
	    REDIRECT #Har /WHOIS bigcheese
	  This sends the result of "WHOIS bigcheese" to channel #Har.  
	  There is an implicit WAIT built into the REDIRECT command.
	  This means that all output will be redirected until the
	  given command has finished executing.  This can have some
	  unpredictable results, so use it with caution.
	  If you want to redirect output to a DCC CHAT connection
	  then specify the last form REDIRECT =nick command.
	  If the nickname|channel is given as the char "*" output will be
	  redirected to the current channel.

	            Users Behavior on the Internet Relay Chat system
	
	
	
	The Internet Relay Network (IRC) is a system for communicating with other
	peoples.
	
	IRC is a free speech system. Users may exchange viewpoints with other
	users. But to protect people from abuse there are certain rules that the 
	user MUST respect.
	
	If a USER doesn't respect the guidelines/rules stated below, then the
	IRC-ADMIN may suspend or reduce the availability for the USER.
	
	These things are prohibited:
	
	   * Using offensive words in channel topics.
	    
	   * Harassing another user. Harassment is defined as behavior towards 
	     another user with the purpose of annoying them. 
	     Harassment is a matter of opinion of the IRC-OP.
	
	   * "Dumping" a lot of text to a channel.
	
	   * Annoying another user or a channel with constant beeping. 
	
	   * Any behavior reducing the functionality of IRC.
	
	What kind of action a user is doing to break these rules are up to the 
	IRC-OP to decide.
	
	Violation should be straighted out via a civilized conversation between
	the IRC-OP and the USER.
	If the USER is not on-line then the USER should be notified by EMail.
	If the USER wont respect what he's been told then it is up to the IRC-ADMIN 
	what to do with the USER.
	
	Many many problems can be avoided all together if the CHAN-OP puts necessary
	restrictions on his/her channel or if the USER learns how to use IGNORE.
	
	If someone finds a USER violating these rules he may contact the USER's
	IRC-ADMIN.
	To find a USERS IRC-ADMIN one may use the /ADMIN <nick-name>.

save
	Usage: SAVE [<options>] [<filename>]
	  This will save all of the settings of IRCII to a file.  It
	  saves all of the Key Bindings, Variables, and Aliases (in that
	  order) in a format such that they can be loaded into IRCII
	  using the LOAD command or the -l switch.  If no filename is
	  given, the your default .ircrc file will be used (unless
	  changed with the -l switch).
	
	  If any of these options are specific, different things occur.
	
	    -ALIAS
	    -ASSIGN
	    -AUTOOP
	    -BIND
	    -FORMAT
	    -ON
	    -SET
	    -NOTIFY
	    -DIGRAPH
	
	  only those `types' are saved.  The -ALL option will save all
	  types and the -FORCE option will supress confirmation.

	  ircII command_line_args
say
	Usage: SAY <text>
	  This command is to permit aliases, binds, scripts and similar to send
	  a message to the current channel as if it were typed. This is equivalent
	  to typing '/ <text>'.

	  ircII programming
sb
	See SBAN for more information about SB.
sban
	Usage: SBAN [<timeout>] [<channel>] <nickname>
	  Site bans a user from a channel.
	
	  If a timeout value is entered, the ban will be removed after that
	  many number of minutes.
	
	See Also:
	  BAN
sbk
	Usage: SBK [<timeout>] [<channel>] <nickname> [<reason>]
	  Site bans and kicks a user from a channel.
	
	  If a timeout value is entered, the ban will be removed after that
	  many number of minutes.

	  SB
	  KICK
send
	Usage: SEND <text>
	  This command is to permit aliases, binds, scripts and similar to send
	  a message to the current channel or query as if it were typed.
	
	See Also:
	  SAY
	  ircII programming
sendline
	Usage: SENDLINE <line of text>
	  SENDLINE will send a line to the client EXACTLY as though you had
	  typed it at the command line.  However, unlike TYPE it is not
	  displayed in the command line.  All alias expansion or command
	  processing is done after it's sent as it normally would be when you 
	  send a line with RETURN.  It can be used with ON ^INPUT
	  if you're extremely careful.

	  ON INPUT
	  SET INPUT_PROTECTION
server
	Usage: SERVER [<name of server>|<number in server_list> [<port>]]
	       SERVER <name of server>[:<port>[:<password>[:<nickname>]]]
	       SERVER [+|-]
	       SERVER -DELETE <number in server_list>
	  Switches your primary server to the server specified at the
	  specified port number.   If no port number is given, the default
	  port number is used.   Your channel and AWAY status will remain
	  unchanged.   Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the
	  irc   network can send out the information that you have left a
	  server.  So don't be surprised if it says your nickname is in 
	  use...  just wait a moment and set it with NICK.  IRCII
	  maintains an internal list of servers you have connected to.
	  To see that list, use SERVER with no arguments.  You may also
	  specify one of the servers in the server list by its number in
	  the list, by issuing:
	    SERVER <number in list>
	  Likewise, you can automatically switch to the next or previous
	  server in the server list by doing:
	    SERVER + 
	  or 
	    SERVER - 
	  to switch to the next and previous server in the list,
	  respectively.  The second form allows you to specify a port,
	  a password and a nickname to be used for this IRC connection.
	  Also, you can set a particular server to be associated with a
	  particular IRCII window.  To do this, set the current window to the
	  window you wish to use and do:
	    SERVER +servername
	  In this case, servername may again be a name, IP address, or number
	  of a server in your server list.
	  This will connect you to the given server as a secondary server in
	  that window.  Doing a /SERVER with no parameters will show you your
	  primary server.  If you kill the last window associated with a
	  server, the connection to that server will close.  If you kill the
	  last window associated with your primary server, a new open server
	  will be chosen as the primary server.  If there are open servers you
	  will not be allowed to close the connection to your primary server.
	  When you create new windows, they will use as their associated
	  server whatever was the server for the current window when the new
	  window was created.  You can therefore have more than one window for
	  any server, but still only one primary server.
	
	  Every time you switch to a new server, it gets
	  added to the server list automatically.  To set up initial
	  servers in the server list, you can specify them on the command
	  line as such:
	    irc <nickname> server1 server2 server3
	  Each host may have it's own port number, password and nickname
	  specified on the command line as well:
	    irc <nickname> server1:6667 server2:7000:blah server3::foo
	  In this case, server1 will use port 6667, server2 will use port
	  7000 with password blah, and server3 will use the default port
	  number with password foo.  The -p switch on the command line
	  allows you to specify the default port number.  Also, if no
	  password is specified and one is needed to connect, you will be
	  prompted to enter a password before you can connect.  You can
	  also specify the default server list in the IRCSERVER
	  environment variable using the same format as above.
	
	Available flags:
	  -DELETE <number in servers list>
	    Allows you to remove servers from the internal server list.

set always_split_biggest
	Usage: SET ALWAYS_SPLIT_BIGGEST [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If ON, all new windows displayed will split in half the largest
	  visible window to make room for themselves.  If OFF, the 
	  current window is always split unless it is too small, then the
	  largest is split.
set auto_nslookup
	Usage: SET AUTO_NSLOOKUP [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If ON, the client will lookup the hostname for an IP when you do
	  a WHOIS or USERHOST of a person with an IP address. This is
	  also done when a person joins a channel.
	
	See Also:
	  NSLOOKUP
set auto_rejoin
	Usage: SET AUTO_REJOIN [<rejoin type>]
	  Determines how to handle rejoining a channel after being kicked:
	    0 - off (do not rejoin)
	    1 - rejoin normally
	    2 - rejoin with the same username as the person who kicked you.
	    3 - rejoin using a random nickname
	    4 - rejoin using a random nickname and the same username as the
		person who kicked you.
	
	See also:
	  JOIN
	  KICK
	  NICK
set auto_reoper
	Usage: SET AUTO_REOPER [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Determines whether to make the client automatically regain server
	  operator status after reconnecting to a server.
	
	  WARNING: When this variable is ON, your plaintext server operator
	  password is stored in memory and might be readable by other processes
	  with sufficient privileges.  Not recommended for use on untrusted
	  systems.  Use at your own risk!
	
	  To wipe your operator password for the currently connected server, use
	  the DEOPER command.  To wipe all operator passwords, set this
	  variable to OFF.  Wiping operator passwords involves writing null
	  characters over the buffer, followed by writing the inverse, then all
	  nulls again.  Finally, the buffer is deallocated from memory.
	
	See also:
	  DEOPER
	  OPER
set auto_unmark_away
	Usage: SET AUTO_UNMARK_AWAY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, you will automatically be unmarked as being away (as
	  if you had issued an AWAY with no arguments) if you send a
	  message to a channel or send a private message.  When OFF, your
	  away status will remain unchanged until you issue the AWAY
	  command with no arguments.
set auto_whowas
	Usage: SET AUTO_WHOWAS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If set to ON, this will automatically generate a 
	    WHOWAS <nickname>
	  for any nick command that results in 
	    *** <nickname>: No such nickname
	  If OFF, you will not be bothered with WHOWASs. 
set autoop_delay
	Usage: SET AUTOOP_DELAY <seconds>
	  This variable tells the AutoOp system how long to wait before auto-
	  matically giving someone ops.  The actual delay is a random value
	  between AUTOOP_DELAY and two times AUTOOP_DELAY.
	
	  The use of AUTOOP_DELAY is highly recommended, as it can help
	  prevent floods of mode changes in large channels.
	
	  If AUTOOP_DELAY is zero, the user is given ops immediately after
	  joining.
	
	See also:
	  AUTOOP
	  SET AUTOOP_ENABLE
set autoop_enable
	Usage: SET AUTOOP_ENABLE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This variable decides whether users listed in the auto-op list should
	  be opped on join.
	
	See also:
	  AUTOOP
set away_recorder
	Usage: SET AWAY_RECORDER [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, all messages you receive while you are set AWAY are 
	  recorded for later playback.

	  AWAY
	  ERASE
	  PLAY
	  SET STATUS_MSGS
set ban_timeout
	Usage: SET BAN_TIMEOUT [<minutes>]
	  This value sets the default ban duration of any kickban or site
	  kickban.  After this amount of time has passed, the bans are
	  automatically removed.
	
	See Also:
	  KB
	  SKB
set banner
	Usage: SET BANNER <some text>
	  Sets the banner string to be displayed to the left of most messages
	  from the client or server.  For example, in the following line:
	
	    *** There are no nicknames being ignored
	
	  The text, "*** ", is the banner.
	
	  NOTE: In server numeric messages, if SHOW_NUMERICS is ON, this
		variable's text will not be displayed.  Instead, the 3-digit
		server numeric will be shown as the banner.
	
	See also:
	  FORMAT
	  SET SHOW_NUMERICS
set beep
	Usage: SET BEEP [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF the audibleness of ^G's when received.  If ON,
	  ^Gs should beep the terminal.  When OFF, ^G's will be treated
	  as other control characters and show up as G in the display.
	  The setting of BEEP does not affect the beeps
	  generated by the BEEP_ON_MSG variable and the BEEP_WHEN_AWAY
	  variable.
	
	See Also:
	  SET BEEP_ON_MSG
	  SET BEEP_WHEN_AWAY
set beep_max
	Usage: SET BEEP_MAX [<number of beeps>]
	  This allows you to limit the maximum number of beeps you will hear
	  for any given messages.  For example, if you set BEEP_MAX to 3,
	  and someone sends a message with more than 10 beeps in it, you
	  will only hear the first three.  Setting BEEP_MAX to 0 means
	  you will hear all beeps in a message.
set beep_on_msg
	Usage: SET BEEP_ON_MSG [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-] <level> ...]
	  This variable lets you specify certain types of messages
	  which will cause an audible beep when you receive one.
	  The possible message levels are:
	    PUBLIC          Channel conversation only
	    MSGS            MSGs only
	    NOTICES         NOTICEs only
	    WALLS           WALLs only
	    WALLOPS         WALLOPs only
	    NOTES           NOTE only
	    CRAP            Is not used.
	  See SET LASTLOG_LEVEL for more on these levels
set beep_when_away
	Usage: SET BEEP_WHEN_AWAY [<value>] 
	  This sets the number of beeps that you will hear when you
	  receive a message while you are AWAY.  Setting the value to 0
	  will not put a limit on the number of beeps.
set bold_video
	Usage: SET BOLD_VIDEO [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When OFF, bold video sent to your display by using the ^B
	  character will not show up in bold.  This can effect the
	  status line but not the input line.
set channel_name_width
	Usage: SET CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH <value>
	  Lets you adjust the amount of space used to display channel
	  names in the LIST and NAMES output and in the status line of
	  IRCII.  If CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH is set to 0, no channel width
	  formatting is performed and channel names are displayed at
	  full width.
set client_information
	Usage: SET CLIENT_INFORMATION <Text of message>
	  This message will be displayed any time someone does a
	  CTCP VERSION on your nickname.
	
	See Also:
	  CTCP VERSION
set clock
	Usage: SET CLOCK [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF the status line clock.  The clock can be set to
	  show 24 hour time as well as 12 hour time (See HELP SET
	  CLOCK_24HOUR).  You can also set an alarm to warn you of the
	  time (See HELP SET CLOCK_ALARM).
set clock_24hour
	Usage: SET CLOCK_24HOUR [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, the status line clock will be displayed in 24 hour
	  format.  When OFF, the status line clock will be displayed in
	  12 hour format with either AM or PM after it.
set clock_alarm
	Usage: SET CLOCK_ALARM [<time>|OFF]
	  Sets an alarm clock that will beep and send you a message when
	  the time arrives.  The time format may be either 12 hour format
	  (with AM or PM) or 24 hour format.  The CLOCK does not have to
	  be ON for the alarm to function.
set cmdchars
	Usage: SET CMDCHARS <character set>
	  Sets the set of characters which may be used to specify a 
	  command to IRCII.  You can specify as many characters as you
	  wish to be command characters.
set command_mode
	Usage: SET COMMAND_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This switch was designed for those who are used to MUDs and computer
	  freaks who like command oriented environments. It will disable the
	  command character! Every input of yours will be expected to be a command.
	  If you want to send something to your current channel or query, you'll
	  have to type "send <text>" or "'<text>".
	  "say <text>" will always send to the channel even if you're in a query.
	  With ":<text>" you get the same effect as with "me <text>".
	
	  The "'" and ":" abbreviations are introduced for MUD compatibility and
	  are only available in COMMAND_MODE.

set continued_line
	Usage: SET CONTINUED_LINE <some text>
	  This allows you to change the text which is displayed when a
	  line is greater than than width of the screen.  By default,
	  this text is a +, and each line greater than the screens width
	  will have this prepended to all lines after the first.   You
	  may use CONTINUED_LINE in conjunction with INDENT, or you may
	  disable the CONTINUED_LINE character by setting it to <EMPTY>.

	  SET INDENT
set dcc_block_size
	Usage: SET DCC_BLOCK_SIZE <size in bytes>
	  Controls the size of blocks sent when sending files 
	  using DCC SEND.
	
	  The default is normally 512. Increasing this number
	  increases network efficiency. Decreasing this number
	  slows down the transfer, but also decreases the chances
	  of the transfer being aborted over bad links.
set debug
	Usage: SET DEBUG <debug level>
	  The DEBUG variable enables three types of debugging
	  output dependant on the settings of various bits.
		bit	value	purpose
		 0	  1	Display all commands executed
		 1	  2	Display all alias substitutions made
		 2	  4	Display all function calls and return values
	  DEBUG 3 will show all command executed and all alias expansions.
	  DEBUG 7 will show EVERYTHING.  It is pretty messy so you might
	  want to set HOLD_MODE on when you use this.
	  Keep in mind that FLUSH will flush pending client output as
	  well, in case you get more than you bargained for.
set default_reason
	Usage: SET DEFAULT_REASON <some text>
	  This is the default kick reasons for masskicks, etc.  Note that
	  this only takes effect if REASON_TYPE is 0.
	
	See Also:
	  SET REASON_TYPE
set display
	Usage: SET DISPLAY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF all output.  When DISPLAY is off ECHO can still
	  produce a message on your screen.
	  DISPLAY is set OFF by default in scripts now, including the .ircrc
	  file.  It is automatically turned back on when the script is done
	  loading.
set eight_bit_characters
	Usage: SET EIGHT_BIT_CHARACTERS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Allows you, if set, to input 8 bit characters.
	  (such as the Swedish character set)
	
	Notes:
	  On SUN machines, you will have to use `stty pass8' and not
	  `stty cs8' to be able to use this properly.
	
	  By default, M-b M-d M-f M-h and M-^? (del) are bound to the 
	  corresponding emacs keys.

	  SET TRANSLATION
	  DIGRAPH
set encrypt_program
	Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM <encryption program path>
	  Sets the program used to encrypt and decrypt messages.  The
	  program selected must take an encryption key as the first
	  command line argument to work with IRCII.
set exec_protection
	Usage: SET EXEC_PROTECTION [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If you saw a warning message telling you to read this, beware!
	  If  anyone on irc told you that typing "ON ^MSG * $1-" or 
	  "ON ^MSG <nick> $1-" would speed speed things up or otherwise
	  make life better for you, they are lying.  The above commands 
	  allow people to send you MSGs and have them executed as commands
	  by your IRCII.  This can be a major security problem, since the
	  person who told you to do this can then execute any command you 
	  could, including EXEC commands.  This would give them control over
	  your account while you are on irc.
	
	  Anyway, if you did see this warning, it could be that someone is
	  trying to abuse your account.  But, don't worry, the EXEC command
	  that it warned you about was not executed.  If you are unsure about
	  what is going on, please contact your local irc operator for help.
	  
	  If you know what you're doing, you can set EXEC_PROTECTION to OFF
	  and EXEC will be allowed within ON commands.  Only do this if 
	  you are sure you understand what is going on.
set fake_host
	Usage: SET FAKE_HOST <some text>
	  This text is displayed instead of your actual hostname in a CTCP
	  FINGER reply.
	
	  This is useful for dialup users with dynamic IPs, as it allows them
	  to display their actual email address.
	
	See Also:
	  SET USE_FAKE_HOST
	  CTCP FINGER
set filter_log
	Usage: SET FILTER_LOG [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns the control character filter ON or OFF for window log files.
	  When ON, non-printable control characters are removed before lines
	  are sent to their log files.

set flood_after
	Usage: SET FLOOD_AFTER <number of messages>
	  Used in conjunction with ON FLOOD, this lets you specify the
	  number of flooding messages you will see before ON FLOOD
	  is activated.  
	
	See Also:
	  ON FLOOD
	  SET FLOOD_RATE

set flood_rate
	Usage: SET FLOOD_RATE <messages per second>
	  FLOOD_RATE can be set to the number of messages per second you 
	  wish to  activate flooding. If messages from a user outpace 
	  FLOOD_RATE for  FLOOD_AFTER number of messages, ON FLOOD is
	  activated.  If FLOOD_RATE is larger then FLOOD_AFTER, then you 
	  will end up seeing at least FLOOD_RATE messages before flood 
	  activation (If FLOOD_RATE is 5 and FLOOD_AFTER is 3 then you must 
	  receive at least 5 messages before the flood rate can be 5
	  messages per second).

set flood_users
	Usage: SET FLOOD_USERS <number of users to monitor>
	  FLOOD_USERS sets the maximum number of users you can have 
	  flood protection from at one time.  If this number is too large, 
	  you may see performance degradations and the flood protection 
	  might not work as well as it should.

set flood_warning
	Usage: SET FLOOD_WARNING [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If ON, you will see a warning when flood protection 
	  is activated.  This is used in conjuction with:
	    ON ^FLOOD *
	  which otherwise will simply cut off flooding messages
	  without a warning to you.  
	
	See Also:
	  ON FLOOD
set full_status_line
	Usage: SET FULL_STATUS_LINE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, IRCII will always draw it's status line to fill the 
	  entire width of the screen.  When OFF, the status line will
	  only be as long as it needs to be to accommodate the displayed
	  information.
set help_file
	Usage: SET HELP_FILE <Path to help file>
	  This path points to the location of the file containing the
	  help text. e.g.
	    SET HELP_FILE /usr/local/share/blackened/1.7.0/help
	
	See Also:
	  HELP
set help_pager
	Usage: SET HELP_PAGER [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When set to OFF, the HELP function will not use it's built
	  in paging mechanism but will use the normal window paging
	  (hold mode).  If ON, then help uses it's own pager.
	
	See Also:
	  SET HOLD_MODE
set help_path
	Usage: SET HELP_PATH <Path to help files>
	  This path points to the location of the directory containing
	  the help files. e.g.
	    SET HELP_PATH /usr/local/lib/irc/help
	
	See Also:
	  HELP
set help_prompt
	Usage: SET HELP_PROMPT [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If SET nothing different happens, but if set OFF, then ircII will
	  not prompt for more help after showing a file.
set help_window
	Usage: SET HELP_WINDOW [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This will cause the HELP function to create a new window for
	  displaying help.  If OFF, the current window will be used.
set hide_private_channels
	Usage: SET HIDE_PRIVATE_CHANNELS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, this will suppress display in your status line of channels 
	  whose mode is +s (secret) or +p (private).  When OFF, channels
	  are shown as usual in the status line.
set highlight_char
	Usage: SET HIGHLIGHT_CHAR [BOLD|BLINK|INVERSE|UNDERLINE]
	  When the + option of IGNORE is used it highlights messages
	  from the specific user.  The setting of this variable
	  determines how the name is to be highlighted.
	
	See Also:
	  IGNORE
set history
	Usage: SET HISTORY <value>
	  Sets the size of the command history circular buffer.  Setting
	  HISTORY to zero disables the command history functions unless you
	  have HISTORY_FILE set.  You must disable HISTORY_FILE to completely
	  turn off command history.
	
	See Also:
	  SET HISTORY_FILE
set history_file
	Usage: SET HISTORY_FILE <path for history file>
	  If HISTORY_FILE is set, then the command history is saved in
	  this file rather than in memory.  The advantage to this is
	  that the size of this file is limited by your disk space and
	  doesn't increase the memory usage of IRCII.  The disadvantage
	  is that history access might be slower (or it might not).  To
	  disable the HISTORY_FILE, set it to <EMPTY>.  To completely
	  disable the command history functions, you must also set
	  HISTORY to 0.
	
	See Also:
	  SET HISTORY
set hold_mode
	Usage: SET HOLD_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, IRCII will pause at the end of each page of output.
	  Output will continue when the TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN function is
	  activated (bound, by default, to ctrl-S) or when the
	  SEND_LINE function is activated (bound, by default, to the
	  Return or Enter key).
	
	Note:
	  If using multiple windows the HOLD_MODE value refers to
	  default setting for new windows.   To effect the hold mode
	  of individual windows refer to WIN HOLD_MODE
	
	See Also:
	  SET STATUS_HOLD
	  WIN HOLD_MODE
set hold_mode_max
	Usage: SET HOLD_MODE_MAX <number of lines>
	  This specifies the maximum number of lines that will be held
	  in HOLD_MODE before the display is automatically restarted.
	  If HOLD_MODE_MAX is 0, the number of lines held in HOLD_MODE
	  is unlimited.
set ign_param
	Usage: SET IGN_PARAM <some text>
	  This text is used as the default parameters for the IGN and IGH
	  commands.
	
	See Also:
	  IGN
	  IGH
set indent
	Usage: SET INDENT [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Setting INDENT to ON will cause lines of text that are longer
	  than the screen width to be indented so that all lines after
	  the first start underneath the second word in the first line.
	  That's a long sentence, but that's what it does.  If you also
	  have CONTINUED_LINE set, this will pad the CONTINUED_LINE
	  characters out to the second word in the first line, unless
	  CONTINUED_LINE is longer.  CONTINUED_LINE will not be
	  truncated.  To disable the CONTINUED_LINE, set it to <EMPTY>.
	  INDENT will never indent beyond 1/3 the width of the screen.
	
	See Also:
	  SET CONTINUED_LINE
set input_aliases
	Usage: SET INPUT_ALIASES [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF the expanding of aliases in the inputline, 
	  If you set INPUT_ALIASES ON and type: ECHO $S
	  you will see your server name echoed to your window.  If it is
	  OFF, you will see $S echoed to your window. INPUT_ALIASES now 
	  has no effect on expansions in the .ircrc and loaded files.  To 
	  Make a line expand when a file is loaded, use EVAL <command>.
	
	  Note also, that when INPUT_ALIASES is ON, text within (..) and {..}
	  are not expanded.  If you want them to be expanded then quote the 
	  leading ( or {.  e.g.   \(  \{ 
	
	  Additionally, You can return to full alias substitution
	  within ${...} by enclosing the substitution text in
	  [...]. Thus  if $0 == test, and $bear == black
	          ${[$0]} expands to "test"
	          ${[$bear]} expands to "black"
	          ${bear} also expands to "black"
	          ${ bear == [black] }  expands to "1",
	          ${ [$0] == [test] } expands to "1"
	          ${ [$0] == [black] } expands to "0"
	          ${ [$0](this) } expands to the return value of $test(this)
	  
	Note:
	  If you do turn on INPUT_ALIASES in the .ircrc then the argument
	  expandos ($*, $0, $1, $3-4, etc) will expand to the command line 
	  arguments passed to IRCII on startup.
set input_prompt
	Usage: SET INPUT_PROMPT <input prompt string>
	  Allows you to change the prompt that will be displayed in the
	  input line before any text you type.  Normally, there is no
	  prompt, but you can specify any string.  To turn off a prompt,
	  use /set -INPUT_PROMPT. Using the special variable $T is
	  useful as in INPUT_PROMPT as it shows what the current 
	  destination is for any input, such as a channelname or nickname
	  if you are using query.
	
	See Also:
	  ALIAS Special
set input_protection
	Usage: SET INPUT_PROTECTION [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When set this variable will prevent you from using the ON INPUT
	  functionality.  ON INPUT is extremely dangerous in that it can
	  easily disable or throw the client into a loop.  Be sure you
	  know what you're doing if you decide to use this function.
	
	See Also:
	  ON INPUT
	  SENDLINE
set insert_mode
	Usage: SET INSERT_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF insert mode.  While on, characters typed are
	  inserted into already existing text.  When off, new characters
	  overwrite existing ones.  Whichever key is bound to the function
	  TOGGLE_INSERT_MODE will toggle this setting on and off. The TAB 
	  key (or ^I) is the default binding.
	
	See Also:
	  BIND TOGGLE_INSERT_MODE
set inverse_video
	Usage: SET INVERSE_VIDEO [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When OFF, inverse video sent to your display by using the ^V
	  character will not show up in inverse.  This can effect the
	  status line but not the input line.
set killlogfile
	Usage: SET KILLLOGFILE <some text>
	  When set, all operator kills are logged to this file.  Note that in
	  order for this to work, you must have umode +sk.
	
	See Also:
	  KILL
	  UMODE
set last_msg
	Usage: SET LAST_MSG <some text>
	  This variable contains the last message you received.
	
	See Also:
	  RELM
set last_notice
	Usage: SET LAST_NOTICE <some text>
	  This variable contains the last notice you received.
	
	See Also:
	  RELN
set last_sendmsg
	Usage: SET LAST_SENDMSG <some text>
	  This variable contains the last message you sent.
	
	See Also:
	  RELS
set last_sendnotice
	Usage: SET LAST_SENDNOTICE <some text>
	  This variable contains the last notice you sent.
	
	See Also:
	  RELSN
set lastlog
	Usage: SET LASTLOG <value>
	  Sets the size of the lastlog buffer (See HELP LASTLOG).  This
	  buffer keeps an in memory record of messages sent and received.
	  If LASTLOG is set to 0, the lastlog function is disabled.
set lastlog_level
	Usage: SET LASTLOG_LEVEL [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
	  The setting of this variable determines which types of
	  messages are stored in the lastlog.  If ALL is specified,
	  everything that shows up on the screen is saved in the
	  lastlog, except DCC mesages, which have to be explicitly
	  set.  eg, to get everything, use
	
	    /SET LASTLOG_LEVEL DCC,ALL
	
	  .  If NONE is specified, nothing is saved in the
	  lastlog.  The <level> specification can be one of the
	  following: 
	    PUBLIC          Channel conversation
	    MSGS            Private messages
	    NOTICES         NOTICEs
	    WALLS           WALLs
	    WALLOPS         WALLOPs
	    NOTE            NOTEs
	    OPNOTES         Operator notifications
	    SNOTES          Server notices
	    ACTIONS         In and outgoing CTCP ACTION lines
	    USERLOG1        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG2        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG3        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG4        Reserved for the user
	    DCC             DCC connections
	    BEEP            Beeps
	    CRAP            Anything not covered by the above categories
	  You can combine these on a command line to make the lastlog
	  save just what you want.  Also, by putting a - before any
	  level, you remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
	  wish to save everything except NOTEs and all that CRAP, you
	  could do:
	    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL ALL -NOTE -CRAP
	  which is the same as doing:
	    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL WALLOP OPNOTES ACTIONS SNOTES
	
	See also:
	  WINDOW NOTIFY_LEVEL
set load_path
	Usage: SET LOAD_PATH <Path to load scripts from>
	  This path controls where the client finds scripts and menus.
	  A typical example would be.
	    SET LOAD_PATH .:~/.irc:/usr/local/lib/irc/script
	
	  Which will first look in the current directory, and then in the 
	  system's irc script directory.  This can of course be set to 
	  anything you want.  If you want to determine if you have the 
	  default scripts, and where they are, use   /WHICH global
	  and that should show you the location of the 'global' script 
	  file.  The directory it's in is also the location of all the 
	  other scripts.

set log
	Usage: SET LOG [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns the session log ON or OFF.  While ON, a record of your
	  IRC session is recorded to file (see HELP SET LOGFILE).  When
	  OFF, no log is made.  This log will contain everything that 
	  appears on your screen, no matter what window, in the order it
	  comes in.  To log an individual window, use the: 
	    WINDOW LOG [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  command.

set loop_reconnect
	Usage: SET LOOP_RECONNECT [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, the client will continue to try to reconnect to an IRC
	  server by looping through the SERVER list.
	
	  When OFF, when the client reaches the end of the SERVER list, it
	  will quit trying to reconnect.
	
	See Also:
	  SERVER
set mail
	Usage: SET MAIL [0|1|2]
	  When non zero, you will be informed when you have new mail.  This
	  is your real unix mail and not irc-mail.  An indicator will light
	  up in your status line and a message will be sent to your screen
	  telling you about the new mail. If set to 2, the more significant
	  headers from the mail are shown.
	
	See Also:
	  ON MAIL_REAL
	  SET STATUS_MAIL
set max_recursions
	Usage: SET MAX_RECURSIONS <A reasonable limit for alias recursions>
	  This will limit the number of times that a particular alias can 
	  call itself recursively.  (default is 10)
	  To see how recursive aliases work take a look at the RECURSION script.
	
	See Also:
	  LOAD RECURSION
set max_wall_nicks
	Usage: SET MAX_WALL_NICKS <maximum number of nicks to wall>
	  This will limit the number of nicks that will be sent messages at the
	  same time when using the WALL or OPS command.  The server may
	  prohibit you from using large values, but small values can cause you
	  to flood yourself off the server when used in large channels.
	
	  This variable has no effect when OPS_METHOD is HYBRID.
	
	See Also:
	  SET OPS_METHOD
	  OPS
	  WALL
set menu
	Usage: SET MENU <Name of menu>
	  Will set the MENU variable to the name of a menu which has
	  been loaded with the MLOAD command.  When MENU is set, the 
	  new menu will appear on the screen.  The key bound to
	  ENTER_MENU is used to get into the menu. (default ^R)

	  MLIST
	  MLOAD
	  BIND ENTER_MENU
set minimum_servers
	Usage: SET MINIMUM_SERVERS <number of servers>
	  When connecting to a server, this variable is checked versus
	  the number of servers currently connected to the ircnet.  If
	  the number of servers is less than the setting of
	  MINIMUM_SERVERS, you will automatically be disconnected from
	  that server and IRCII will attempt to connect to the next
	  server in you server list (as though you had done SERVER +).
	  This is useful if the net is fragmented to keep you on a more
	  populated portion of the net.  This will be rechecked if you
	  issue a LUSERS.  This will only affect your primary server. 
	  Secondary servers are not checked vs this variable.

	Usage: SET MINIMUM_USERS <number of users>
	  When connecting to a server, this variable is checked versus
	  the number of users currently connected to the ircnet.  If
	  the number of users is less than the setting of
	  MINIMUM_USERS, you will automatically be disconnected from
	  that server and IRCII will attempt to connect to the next
	  server in you server list (as though you had some SERVER +).
	  This is useful if the net is fragmented to keep you on a more
	  populated portion of the net.  This will be rechecked if you
	  issue a LUSERS.  This only affects your primary server.

set ops_method
	Usage: SET OPS_METHOD [DEFAULT|WALLCHOPS|HYBRID|AUTO]
	  Determines how the OPS and WALL commands send messages to all
	  channel operators.
	
	  When set to DEFAULT, the commands use the old-style method of sending
	  messages to multiple targets.  Use SET MAX_WALL_NICKS to tune the
	  maximum number of nicknames to message at one time.
	
	  When set to WALLCHOPS, the client will use the server WALLCHOPS
	  command.  Some servers may not support this method, however recent
	  versions of the Undernet ircd do.
	
	  When set to HYBRID, the client will use the method of sending a
	  message to @#channel.  Some servers may not support this method, however
	  Hybrid versions 6 and higher do.

set scroll
	Usage: SET SCROLL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  Turns ON or OFF screen scrolling.  While OFF, when the cursor
	  reaches the bottom of the screen, it jumps to the top and
	  overwrites its way back down.  This mode is recommended for
	  *extremely* dumb terminals.  When ON, the screen will scroll
	  old information off the top.
set scroll_lines
	Usage: SET SCROLL_LINES [<number of screen lines to scroll>]
	  This allows you to set the number of lines the screen will
	  scroll each time the cursor reaches the bottom of the screen.
	  If SCROLL_LINES is set to 0, the SCROLL is turned OFF as well,
	  and must be turned back on before scrolling can be resumed.

set shell_flags
	Usage: SET SHELL_FLAGS <flags>
	  Sets any additional flags that the shell (set with SET SHELL)
	  might need. For most shells the -c flag is needed.  This tells
	  the shell to take the command line as a command to be parsed
	  rather than a filename.  The flag -f is also added sometimes, and
	  with csh and tcsh this means to ignore the .cshrc file when a 
	  command is executed.  This means aliases will not be available but
	  the command will execute faster.
set shell_limit
	Usage: SET SHELL_LIMIT <value>
	  Sets the maximum number of lines of output from any EXEC'd
	  process.  This is useful to prevent yourself from accidentally
	  starting a process with EXEC that spits out soooo much output
	  that everything you know and love grinds to a halt.  Setting
	  it to 0 puts no limit on the number of output lines from a
	  process.
set show_admin_requests
	Usage: SET SHOW_ADMIN_REQUESTS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]

	       N          Your current nickname.
	       C          Your current channel.
	       R          Current window refnum or name.

	       T          Value of STATUS_CLOCK variable. *
	       U          Value of STATUS_USER variable. *
	       X Y Z      Value of STATUS_USER1,2,3 variables. *
	       H          Value of STATUS_HOLD variable. *
	       *          Value of STATUS_OPER variable. *
	       @          Value of STATUS_CHANOP variable. *
	       -          Value of STATUS_CHANVOICE variable. *
	       M          Value of STATUS_MAIL variable. *
	       G          Value of STATUS_MSGS variable. *
	       #	  Value of STATUS_UMODE variable.

	       >          Makes anything beyond it right justified.
	       %          Replaced by %
	
	  Those marked with * are only displayed in the status line when
	  certain conditions are met.  Please get help on the variables
	  mentioned above for specifics about each one.
	
	  For example, the standard default IRCII status line format
	  looks like this:
	
	  %T[%R] %*%@%N %S%H%Q%A%C%+%I%O%M%U %W
	  which when expanded for the nickname Dae on the channel #blue
	  [1] @Dae on #blue (+tn) * type /help for help 
	
	  The window number %R is 1
	  The nickname %N is Dae   and Dae is a channel op %@  @
	  Dae is on channel %C #blue
	  The mode %+ calls up the contents of the STATUS_MODE variable
	      and displays the channel modes, (+ps)
	  The end of the status_format $U expands to the contents of
	      STATUS_USER which contains.. "* type /help for help"
	  
	  Everything else is ignored unless it's needed.
	 
	  You can now include text modification characters
	  (^B, ^V, ^_ and ^O) in STATUS_FORMAT. If you change
	  the format at the start of STATUS_FORMAT, you will
	  have to do it again after any %C or %U, as these
	  both reset it to reverse video.

	  The value of STATUS_UMODE is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT
	  variable for an occurence of %# if the window's current
	  nickname has any of the mode settings active.  The STATUS_UMODE
	  variable may contain one occurence of %# which will be
	  replaced with the current user mode.
set status_user
	Usage: SET STATUS_USER <text of status line user information>
	  The value of STATUS_USER is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT
	  variable for any occurence of %U. If STATUS_USER is set to

set suppress_server_motd
	Usage: SET SUPPRESS_SERVER_MOTD [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This will prevent you from seeing the motd from the server when you
	  connect to a server.  This is not to be confused with the IRCII motd
	  which your installation may or may not have.  You will still see the
	  server motd if you use the /MOTD command.
set tab
	Usage: SET TAB [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, tabs are parsed and the cursor is moved to the next tab stop.
	
	See Also:
	  SET TAB_MAX
set tab_max
	Usage: SET TAB_MAX [<number of tabs>]
	  This allows you to limit the maximum number of tabs you will hear
	  for any given messages.  For example, if you set TAB_MAX to 3,
	  and someone sends a message with more than 10 tabs in it, you
	  will only see the first three tabs.  Setting TAB_MAX to 0 means
	  you will see all tabs in a message.
set timestamp
	Usage: SET TIMESTAMP <format description for timestamps>
	  Setting the variable allows you to alter the appearance of
	  timestamps.  Certain special characters are recognized in
	  this format line and replaced with various bits of status line
	  information.  Each of these special characters is preceeded by
	  a '%'.  Please read the strftime man page on your system to
	  determine which characters are supported.
set translation
	Usage: SET TRANSLATION <character translation table>
	  The TRANSLATION variable defines a character translation
	  table.  By default, ircII assumes that all text processed
	  over the network is in the ISO 8859/1 map, also known as
	  Latin-1.  This is identical to standard ASCII, except that
	  it is extended with additional characters in the range
	  128-255.  Many environments by default use the Latin-1 map,
	  such as X Windows, MS Windows, AmigaDOS, and modern ANSI
	  terminals including Digital VT200, VT300, VT400 series and
	  MS-Kermit.  However, many older environments use non-standard
	  extensions to ASCII, and yet others use 7-bit national
	  replacement sets.
	
	  Some available settings for the TRANSLATION variable:
	
	  8-bit sets:
	    HP_MCS              Hewlett Packard Extended Roman 8.
	    MACINTOSH           Apple Macintosh computers and boat

	    CP850               New IBM PC compatibles and IBM PS/2.
	    DEC_MCS             DEC Multinational Character Set.
	                        VAX/VMS.  VT320's and other 8-bit
	                        Digital terminals use this set by
	                        default, but I recommend changing to
	                        Latin-1 in the terminal Set-Up.

set underline_video
	Usage: SET UNDERLINE_VIDEO [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When OFF, underline video sent to your display by using the ^_
	  character will not show up in underline.  This can effect the
	  status line but not the input line.
set urllog_file
	Usage: SET URLLOG_FILE <some text>
	  Determines the filename of the URL log.
	
	  URL logging can be disabled by clearing this variable or by setting
	  URLLOG_LEVEL to NONE.
	
	See Also:
	  SET URLLOG_LEVEL
set urllog_level
	Usage: SET URLLOG_LEVEL [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
	  The setting of this variable determines which types of messages
	  are written to the URL log.  If ALL is specified, all lines
	  containing URLs that show up on the screen are saved to the URL
	  log, except DCC mesages, which have to be explicitly set.
	  eg, to get everything, use
	
	    /SET URLLOG_LEVEL DCC,ALL
	
	  If NONE is specified, nothing is saved in the URL log.  The <level>
	  specification can be one of the following: 
	    PUBLIC          Channel conversation
	    MSGS            Private messages
	    NOTICES         NOTICEs
	    WALLS           WALLs
	    WALLOPS         WALLOPs
	    NOTE            NOTEs
	    OPNOTES         Operator notifications
	    SNOTES          Server notices
	    ACTIONS         In and outgoing CTCP ACTION lines
	    USERLOG1        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG2        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG3        Reserved for the user
	    USERLOG4        Reserved for the user
	    DCC             DCC connections
	    BEEP            Beeps
	    CRAP            Anything not covered by the above categories
	
	  You can combine these on a command line to make the URL log
	  save just what you want.  Also, by putting a - before any
	  level, you remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
	  wish to save everything except NOTEs and all that CRAP, you
	  could do:
	    SET URLLOG_LEVEL ALL -NOTE -CRAP
	  which is the same as doing:
	    SET URLLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL WALLOP OPNOTES ACTIONS SNOTES
	
	  In order to be recognized, URLs must begin with "http://".

set use_fake_host
	Usage: SET USE_FAKE_HOST [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, the text in FAKE_HOST replaces your actual hostname in
	  CTCP FINGER output.

	  SET FAKE_HOST
	  CTCP FINGER
set user_information
	Usage: SET USER_INFORMATION <Text of message>
	  This message will be displayed any time someone does a
	  CTCP USERINFO on your nickname.
	  It is set to "<None Supplied>" be default.
set user_wallops
	Usage: SET USER_WALLOPS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This variable filters incoming user wallops out,
	  if you set it to OFF.
set userhost_notify
	Usage: SET USERHOST_NOTIFY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, signon messages will display the user's full address.
	
	See also:
	  NOTIFY
set verbose_ctcp
	Usage: SET VERBOSE_CTCP [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When this is set ON, you will see any CTCP queries
	  anyone sends to your client.
set verbose_whokill
	Usage: SET VERBOSE_WHOKILL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  When ON, WHOKILL kill reasons are appended with the user's
	  user@host mask and IRC server information.
	
	See Also:
	  WHOKILL
set vhost
	Usage: SET VHOST <virtual host name>
	  Change the virtual host name/address from which you connect to IRC
	  servers.
	
	See also:

	Usage: SET XTERM_OPTIONS <options>
	  Sets the options that are passed to xterm, when using
	  WINDOW CREATE

	See QUIT for more information about SIGNOFF.
skb
	See SBK for more information about SKB.
sleep
	Usage: SLEEP <number of seconds>
	  This suspends IRCII for the number of seconds given.  NOTHING happens
	  during this time.  This is really only useful for automatons.

	  TIMER
sping
	Usage: SPING [-clear] [<server>]
	  Sends a ping to a server and displays the amount of time it took
	  to go to the server and back.
	
	  If no server is given, a list of servers which you are waiting for
	  ping replies from is displayed.
	
	  If the -clear argument is used, all currently pending server
	  pings are removed from the queue.
	
	See Also:
	  PING
squit
	Usage: SQUIT <servername>
	  Sends a server quit to the named server.
	  This is an operator command and unfortunately if it is 
	  messed up, it can effect MANY people so it's best that
	  one knows EXACTLY what they are doing when they squit
	  a server.  A common mistake is to use a server mask 
	  like if you are on some.server.edu and you typed 
	    SQUIT ircserver.*
	  expecting to break off ircserver.iastate.edu it instead it finds 
	  ircserver.et.tudelft.nl and squits it from it's uplink.
	  IF you're going to use a hostmask then make sure that 
	  you supply enough of the name to keep from messing up
	  the net.  There are more pitfalls, but you should read 
	  the docs in the ircd source for those.
	
	Note:
	  SQUIT SHOULD NEVER EVER BE USED FOR A PERSONAL VENDETA
	  It simply hurts the users.
stack
	Usage: STACK <operation> <type> <parameters>
	  This command manages Blackened stacks.
	
	  A stack operation and type are required.
	
	  Stack Operations:
	    LIST	lists the stack
	    PUSH	places a new item on the stack
	    POP		removes an item from the stack
	
	  Stack Types:
	    ALIAS	aliases
	    ASSIGN	ASSIGN variables
	    ON		ON hooks
	    SET		SET variables
	    FORMAT	FORMAT strings

stats
	Usage: STATS [c|h|k|i|l|m|u|y] [<server>]
	  Shows some irc server usage statistics.
	  c - Shows C and N lines for a given server.  These are 
	      the names of the servers that are allowed to connect.
	  h - Shows H and L lines for a given server (Hubs and Leaves).
	  k - Show K lines for a server.  This shows who is not 
	      allowed to connect and possibly at what time they are
	      not allowed to connect.
	  i - Shows I lines. This is who CAN connect to a server.
	  l - Shows information about amount of information passed
	      to servers and users.
	  m - Shows a count for the number of times the various 
	      commands have been used since the server was booted.
	  o - Shows the list of authorized operators on the server.
	  u - Shows the uptime for a server
	  y - Shows Y lines, which lists the various connection 
	      classes for a given server.
summon
	Usage: SUMMON <userid>[@<server>]
	  Summons a user to irc.  The user currently must be logged into
	  the server machine for this to function.
	  Most irc servers do not have this feature, so don't be 
	  surprised if it doesn't work.
switch
	Usage: SWITCH (<expression>) { (<match>) { <commands> } ... }
	  This command works similarly to the C switch statement.  An expression
	  is evaluated and matched with one or more possibilities.  When a match
	  is found, the immediately following command(s), enclosed in curly
	  brackets, is (are) executed.
	
	  Only the first match, if one exists, is executed.  Therefore, the order
	  of match expressions may influence the behavior of the SWITCH command.
	
	Example:
	  switch ($name)
	  {
	    (Bob) { echo What's up, Bob? }
	    (Frank) { echo Howdy, Frank! }
	    (Wendy) { echo Where's the beef? }
	    (*) { echo I don't know you! }

time
	See DATE for more information about TIME.
timer
	Usage: TIMER [-refnum <num>] [-delete <num>] <seconds> [<command>]
	  Waits for the given number of seconds and then executes the
	  command.  This is done without hindering normal operation of
	  the client.  Any number of TIMERs can be set at once, and
	  all will activate at the appropriate time.
	    TIMER with arguments will list pending TIMERs.
	    TIMER -refnum <num>
	  will assign a specific number to that action allowing you
	  to delete it later if necessary with
	    TIMER -delete <num>
	  If no refnum is specified, one is automatically assigned.
tkline
	Usage: TKLINE <time> <userhost_mask> <reason>
	  Adds a temporary K: line to the server config file. The kline will
	  last for the given time in minutes. Note that some ircd versions do
	  not support this feature.

	  FINDK
	  UNKLINE
topic
	Usage: TOPIC [<channel>] [<topic for channel>]

	  You have to be on the channel to change the topic and if
	  the channel mode is +t then only a channel-operator can change
	  the topic.
trace
	Usage: TRACE [<server>]
	  Without a specified server it shows the current connections on
	  the local server.  If you specify a remote server it will show
	  all servers between your current server and that remote server
	  as well as the connections on that remote server.
tracekill
	Usage: TRACEKILL <user@host> <reason>
	  Kills all users matching the user@host mask on your server.

	  Kills all users matching the user@host mask on the server.
	
	See Also:
	  KILL
	  OPER
type
	Usage: TYPE <keystrokes>
	  The TYPE command simulates keyboard keystrokes.  You can
	  include control characters as well as normal characters and
	  they will respond as they would as if typed at the keyboard.
	  A control key is specified by a ^ before the letter.  For
	  example:
	    TYPE Testing^B^B^B go^E
	  will type the word "Testing", move the cursor left three
	  spaces, then type " go" and move the cursor to the end of the
	  line,  leaving "Test going" on the input line.  This will
	  probably happen too fast to see.

userhost
	Usage: USERHOST <nickname> [<nickname> .. ] [-cmd <command>]
	  If only USERHOST nickname is supplied the server will be queried
	  for information about that person.  It will return something in
	  the format:
	    *** Daemon is frechett@spot.Colorado.EDU (Is an IRC operator)
	  If -cmd command   is added then it will parse the returned line
	  just as though it were an ON or an ALIAS.
	  Parameters are:
	    $0  nickname
	    $1  '+' if server operator, '-' otherwise
	    $2  '+' if marked away, '-' if here
	    $3  username
	    $4  hostname
	
	Note:  Something you may run into if you use this command within an
	  ALIAS or ON is the following.  Take the following example.
	    alias bonk userhost $0 -cmd echo \($$*\)
	  When bonk is called, $0 is expanded to a nickname, and $$* changes to
	  $* to be used by userhost -cmd.  However, since the entire expression
	  is parsed twice, the \'s are eaten the first time leaving ($*) which
	  will never expand.  Thsu to make the above alias work, it has to be:
	    alias bonk userhost $0 -cmd echo \\\($$*\\\)
	  On the first pass it becomes   userhost nick -cmd echo \($*\)
	  and on the second pass when the -cmd part is executed it
	  expands and executes   echo (contents of $*)
	  This is NOT a special case or a bug.  It is just an added level of
	  processing...

users
	Usage: USERS [<channel>] [<wildcards>] [<options>] [<reason>]
	  Performs some action on users matching the wildcards and options
	  in a channel.  If no options are given, a list of users is shown
	  instead.
	
	  Valid options:
	    -OPS    -- makes it only select ops
	    -NONOPS -- makes it only select non-ops
	    -KILL   -- kills users matching the pattern
	    -MSG    -- sends a msg to all users matching the pattern
	    -NOTICE -- sends a notice to all users matching the pattern
ver
	Usage: VER [<nickname>]
	  This command will send a CTCP VERSION to the given nickname or
	  nicknames.  The remote client will reply with its version
	  information.  Do not use with too long a list of nicknames or
	  server flood control will kick in and the return times will be
	  inaccurate.
	
	  If no nickname is given, the query is sent to the current
	  channel.
	
	See Also:
	  CTCP
version
	Usage: VERSION [<server>]
	  Shows the IRCII version number and the version number of the
	  server specified.  If no server name is specifed, the version
	  of your current server is shown.
voice
	Usage: VOICE [<channel>] <nickname> [<nickname> ...]
	  Gives voice to one or more users in a channel.
	
	See Also:
	  DEVOICE
	  MODE
w
	See WHO for more information about W.
wait
	Usage: WAIT [%process] [-cmd <command> <do_command>]
	  There are several forms of this command.  The first, and best is:
	    WAIT -CMD command
	
	  WAIT causes the command to be executed when server output
	  that hasn't yet arrived, finally arrives.  This allows you to
	  take a specific action immediately after receiving output from 
	  the server, or client.
	
	  For example, the following alias:
	    ALIAS BACKWARDS wait -cmd echo hello there;echo hi there
	  will actually display "hi there" before "hello there", because
	  the "hello there" echo is not executed until a WAIT token is
	  received from the server.  If for instance you wanted to make
	  sure to execute some command after the completion of a TRACE
	  of your server, the format would be.
	    TRACE
	    WAIT -CMD command
	  Note: This doesn't work for commands that depend on another server to 
	  send you information. TRACE <remote server> for instance.
	
	  The second form of the command is:
	    WAIT -CMD %process command
	  Where %process is a valid running processes id or name.  This is
	  used to cause IRCII to execute the command after the process has
	  exited.  If the given process doesn't exist, return is immediate.
	  Here is an example of it's use:
	    alias uptime {
	      exec -name uptime uptime
	      wait %uptime -cmd echo The time is $uptime
	    }
	    alias dotime uptime
	    on ^exec uptime assign uptime $1
	  When dotime is called, a request will be sent to get the uptime.
	  The ON EXEC will catch the time and assign it to the variable 
	  'uptime' at the same time that the alias is at the 'wait %uptime'
	  stage, when the process exits, WAIT will continue and execute 
	  echo The time is $uptime, where '$uptime' has been set already.
	
	  If you are echoing output to the screen from within the WAIT -CMD
	  form, it is probably a good idea to record the current window
	  and use XECHO -WINDOW to ensure that output goes where it should.
	
	  The last form of WAIT is no longer recommended.  It can be 
	  used in the form of
	    WAIT
	  or
	    WAIT %process
	
	  This suspends he client until the server has finished output, and 
	  has innumerable problems, among them being:
	
	  - If one WAIT is executed while another is pending,
	    both will be registered as satisfied when the first
	    returns. A warning is now issued when this happens.
	
	  - If you are in a prompted input sequence (such as oper
	    password, confirmation prompts, and $".." input),
	    results can be unpredictable.
	
	  - It is not consistant with the message driven programming
	    model which exists in ircII.
	
	  With multi window enhancements the problems with WAIT become even
	  more prohibitive, unless used in the -CMD form.
wall
	See OPS for more information about WALL.
wallops
	Usage: WALLOPS <message>
	  Sends a message to all operators currently on irc.  
	  This command has deteriorated to the point that it 
	  is no longer useful, and most OPERATORS have removed 
	  it from the server all together.  A classic example
	  of a good idea abused till it's worthless.

which
	Usage: WHICH <script name>
	
	  WHICH will attempt to find a given script name in your 
	  LOAD_PATH. E.g. WHICH global might return:
	    /usr/local/lib/irc/script/global
	
	See Also:
	  SET LOAD_PATH
	  CD
while
	Usage: WHILE <boolean> { <cmd> }
	  This will execute the given cmd while the given boolean returns
	  true.  The boolean has the same format as for the IF command, except
	  that it is re-evaluated at each loop interation.  The same is true
	  for cmd.  It is re-evaluated at each loop interation.
	  Example (in script format):
	    alias repeat
	    {
	      @ rep = 0;
	      while (rep < [$0])
	      {
	        $1-
	        @ rep = rep + 1
	      }
	      assign -rep
	    }
	
	  This can be used as follows:
	    /repeat 10 /msg bigcheese This repeats 10 times
	  The repeat alias breaks down into three parts.
	
	    @ rep = 0 
	    while (rep < [$0]) {$1-;@ rep = rep + 1}
	    assign -rep
	
	  The first is to initialize rep to 0 and the last part is to remove
	  rep when done.  The first is just like ASSIGN rep 0
	  The WHILE portion is described below:
	  The boolean for the while loop is (rep < [$0]).
	  This is what is then used at each loop interation.  At the
	  first iteration this will be ( 0<10 ),  at the next ( 1<10 ), and so on.
	  The cmd part of this looks like {$1-;@ rep = rep + 1}
	  When the alias is first parsed, the stuff inside {..} is not expanded but
	  is simply executed at each loop interation.  It expands to
	    'msg bigcheese This repeats 10 times.;@ rep = rep + 1'
	  It sends the MSG to BigCheese and then it increments rep by 1.  
	  (See HELP @ for more information about this assignment) 
	
	  The command part while is exactly like the syntax in IF
	  and FOREACH.

	  IF
	  FOREACH
	  @
	  expressions
who
	Usage: WHO [-switch [<arg>]] [<wildcard expression>]
	  Gives a listing of the users on irc.  If no flags are
	  specified, the wildcard expression you supply will 
	  match any field returned by WHO.  However, if the wildcard
	  expression is "*" (an asterisk), the users on the current
	  channel are shown.  Note that WHO * will fail if you 
	  are not on a channel.  If the expression is 0, all users on 
	  irc are shown.  The following switches are also recognized 
	  and used to limit the listing:
	    -OPERATORS            - lists only operators
	    -LUSERS		  - lists only non operators
	    -CHOPS		  - lists only channel operators
	    -NAME <username>      - lists only people with matching 
	                            user-ids
	    -FILE <filename>      - lists only people listed in the
				    file
	    -HOST		  - Lists users from the specified host.
	    -SERVER		  - Lists users from the specified server.
	    -HERE		  - Lists only those marked as here.
	    -AWAY		  - Lists only those marked away.
	    -NICK 		  - Match only the given nickname
	
	  The switches may be abbreviated unambiguously.  All matching of
	  usernames, hostnames, and servernames may contain wildcards (*).
	  Wildcards in the form "*.edu" are also correctly recognized
	  by the IRC server (so there's no need for ircII to do that).
whois
	Usage: WHOIS <nickname>
	       WHOIS <nick1>,<nick2> [...]
	       WHOIS <server> <nickname>[,<nick2>...]
	  Shows more detailed information about the nickname specified.
	  This info includes the users name, host, server, "real" name,
	  and away message.  As you can see in the second line you can
	  use WHOIS on multiple nicknames. The third line demonstrates
	  how you can send the WHOIS request to a distant server. If
	  you WHOIS a person on his server you will receive extra info
	  about his idle time.
	    WHOIS nickname nickname
	  where the two nicknames are the same will query the user's server
	  about his information just like the WHOIS <server> <nickname> form.

whokill
	Usage: WHOKILL <pattern> <reason>
	  Performs a WHO on the given pattern and kills all matches.
	  For example:
	    WHOKILL * die die die!
	  This will kill all users in the current channel (except you).

window add
	Usage: WINDOW ADD [^]<n>  
	  Adds <n> to window namelist, where <n> is either a nick or channel 
	  name.  All communication with <n> will go to that window.  Also, <n>
	  may be a comma separated list (no spaces).  If <n> is prefixed with
	  a ^, the nick is removed
	
	See Also:
	  WINDOW REMOVE
window addgroup
	Usage: WINDOW ADDGROUP <name>
	  Sets the server group to <name> for the window.  ircII will
	  attempt to always keep windows with the same server group
	  name connected to the same server.  i.e.:  If you set up
	  windows 3, 5 and 6 as being in server group `foo', (with the
	
	  WINDOW ADDGROUP foo
	
	  command) then, when one of these three windows are connected
	  to a server, the other two are also connected to this server.
window back
	Usage: WINDOW BACK
	  Set the current window to the previous current window
	  swapping the current window with the new one if it was
	  hidden.
window balance
	Usage: WINDOW BALANCE
	  Causes all windows to resize so they are as close as possible to 
	  evenly sized.
window channel
	Usage: WINDOW CHANNEL <c>  
	  Directs all conversation with channel <c> to the current window. 
	  If you are not current on channel <c>, you will join it. If you 
	  are on channel <c> it will be diverted to the current window, 
	  possibly removing channel <c> from another window.
window create
	Usage: WINDOW CREATE
	  Creates a new ircII window by either opening a new 'screen' window
	  or 'xterm' window depending on the environment.  'screen' is a 
	  popular program which allows multiple windows to be recalled under
	  unix and displayed one at a time on even a vt100 terminal.
	  The X environment is a graphical interface for high resolution
	  monitors usually attached to UNIX machines.
	
	  Currently, all xterms must be the same size as each other.
	
	  See also:
	    WINDOW DELETE
window delete
	Usage: WINDOW DELETE
	  Destroys a screen or xterm ircII window, depending on the environment.
	  You can't WINDOW DELETE the main screen (the one ircII
	  was started in).

	See Also:
	  WINDOW ADDGROUP
window double
	Usage: WINDOW DOUBLE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This controls whether to use a two-line status line
	  in the current window.
window goto
	Usage: WINDOW GOTO <n>
	  Set the current window to the n'th window visible on the screen. 
	  They are numbered from the 1 being the topmost window.
window grow
	Usage: WINDOW GROW <n> 
	  Increases the size of the current window by n lines.
	
	See also:
	  BIND GROW_WINDOW
window hide
	Usage: WINDOW HIDE
	  Make the current window "hidden".  It still exists in every way 
	  except it takes up no space on the screen.
window hide_others
	Usage: WINDOW HIDE_OTHERS  
	  This hides all visible windows but the current window.
window hold_mode
	Usage: WINDOW HOLD_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This controls hold mode for the current window.
	  The settings of the system variable HOLD_MODE is used as 
	  default for new windows created.  If more than one window 
	  exists, then executing a SET HOLD_MODE will change the 
	  settings for the current window only. 
window kill
	Usage: WINDOW KILL
	  Removes the current window.  This does not remove you from any 
	  channel you were on in that window.
window kill_others
	Usage: WINDOW KILL_OTHERS  
	  This kills all visible windows but the current window.
window lastlog_level
	Usage: WINDOW LASTLOG_LEVEL <l>  
	  Where <l> is the same as for LEVEL, this controls what types of 
	  messages displayed in the current window should be saved to the 
	  windows lastlog.
	
	See Also:
	  SET LASTLOG_LEVEL for a complete description of the LEVEL parameters.
window level
	Usage: WINDOW LEVEL <l>
	  Where <l> is a comma separated list of one of the following: 
	  CRAP, PUBLIC, MSG, NOTICE, WALL, WALLOP, NOTE, ALL, or NONE.  
	  This controls what types of messages will go to the current 
	  window.
	
	  No information is ever lost.  Anything that doesn't otherwise
	  have a specific window to go to (because it is a window's
	  current channel or QUERY user) will either go to the current
	  window, or the window whose LEVEL setting contains an
	  appropriate type for that message. By default, the first
	  window created has a LEVEL of NONE, meaning that no messages
	  will go to that window unless otherwise specified.
	
	  Output from NAMES, LIST, WHO... fall under the CRAP category
	  for LEVEL. If you want, for example, these messages to always go
	  to the current window, you can type this:
	    WINDOW LEVEL CRAP
	  Now, all "crap" will remain in this window, while all private messages,
	  walls, wallops, mail, and notices will go to your current window.
	  
	See Also:
	  SET LASTLOG_LEVEL for a full description of the LEVEL parameters.
window list
	Usage: WINDOW LIST 
	  Show a list of all windows in the following format...
	    *** Ref  Nick      Name  Channel    Query     Server     Level
	    *** 1    Daemon    <Non  #twilight_ <None>    ucsu.color NONE
window log
	Usage: WINDOW LOG [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This turns on logging for the current window only.
	  If no logfile name has been set with WINDOW LOGFILE,
	  the logfile name is created from the current setting of the LOGFILE
	  variable and the name of the window channel, query user, or simply
	  the word "Window" with the windows internal reference number added
	  to the end.  For example, if LOGFILE is set to "IrcLog", and you are
	  on channel "#Har", the log file for the window will be "IrcLog.#Har".  
	
	See Also:
	  WINDOW LOGFILE
	  SET LOG
	  SET LOGFILE
window logfile
	Usage: WINDOW LOGFILE [<filename>]
	  Sets the name of the file to be used for the log of this window.
	  New window logs are appended to the end of this file.
	
	  Nothing is appended to this name, if you use WINDOW LOG.
	  If you don't set a logfile for the window, and call WINDOW LOG,
	  ircII creates a name for you.

	  WINDOW LOG
	  SET LOG
	  SET LOGFILE
window move
	Usage: WINDOW MOVE <n>  
	  Moves the current window n positions on the screen.  Eg, MOVE 1 
	  will move the current window down 1 on the screen.  Window 
	  proportions are maintained using MOVE.
window name
	Usage: WINDOW NAME <name>
	  Sets a <name> for the window, which may now be used in place of
	  the refnum assigned by ircII.
window new
	Usage: WINDOW NEW
	  Creates a new window by splitting either current window, or the 
	  largest window on the screen. 
	
	See Also:
	  SET ALWAYS_SPLIT_BIGGEST.
	  BIND NEW_WINDOW
window next
	Usage: WINDOW NEXT
	  Set the current window to the next numbered window swapping the
	  current window with the new one if it was hidden.
window notify
	Usage: WINDOW NOTIFY
	  Toggles notification for the current window when it is 
	  invisible. If set to ON, the first text written to the window 
	  after it is hidden will cause a line to be displayed in the 
	  current window at that time.
window notify_level
	Usage: WINDOW NOTIFY_LEVEL <l>  
	  Where <l> is the same as for LEVEL, this controls what types of 
	  messages trigger STATUS_NOTIFY.
	
	  NOTIFY_LEVEL understands BEEP as a level.  Any beep occurring in
	  the window will trigger STATUS_NOTIFY.

window number
	Usage: WINDOW NUMBER <n>  
	  Changes the REFNUM associated with the current window to <n>,
	  possibly causing a swap with the current window, and the current
	  window <n>.
window pop
	Usage: WINDOW POP 
	  Pops the top window off the window stack making it the current 
	  window.  If it is hidden, then makes it visible first.
window previous
	Usage: WINDOW PREVIOUS
	  Set the current window to the last numbered window
	  swapping the current window with the new window if
	  it was hidden.
window prompt
	Usage: WINDOW PROMPT <s>
	  Sets the input prompt for the window. It will replace $T as the 
	  window target when used in the INPUT_PROMPT variable. The 
	  window prompt is set automatically when EXEC detects a 
	  prompt from a process.
window push
	Usage: WINDOW PUSH
	  Push the current window onto the window stack.
window refnum
	Usage: WINDOW REFNUM <r> 
	  Change the current window to the window with refnum <r>.
window remove
	Usage: WINDOW REMOVE <n>  
	  Removes <n> to window namelist, where <n> is either a nick or channel 
	  name.  All communication with <n> will go to that window.  Also, <n>
	  may be a comma separated list (no spaces).
	
	See Also:
	  WINDOW ADD
window scroll
	Usage: WINDOW SCROLL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  This controls scrolling for the current window.
	  The settings of the system variable SCROLL is used as are 
	  used as default for new windows created.  If more than one 
	  window exists, then executing a SET SCROLL will change 
	  the settings for the current window only. 
window server
	Usage: SERVER <server>:<portnumber>:<password>:<nickname>
	  This allows you to specify a different server to connect to for 
	  the current window. The <portnumber> and <password> are optional. 
	  If you are already connected to the specified server, the window 
	  will switch to that server.  Doing a WINDOW with no parameters 
	  shows you what server is associated with it.

	Usage: WINDOW STACK
	  Show all the windows in the window stack.
window sticky
	Usage: WINDOW STICKY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
	  If OFF, channels are not kept on windows, and may be
	  lost when disconnected from the server.
window swap
	Usage: WINDOW SWAP <r>  
	  Swaps the current window with the hidden window with refnum <r>.  
	  The proportions of the window are maintained.
window
	Usage: WINDOW [<argument> [<argument> <argument> ...]]
	  The WINDOW command lets you manipulate multiple "windows" in
	  ircII.  Windows are horizontally divided sections of the
	  screen in which different bits of irc information can be
	  displayed.  WINDOW lets you create, manipulate, and remove
	  such windows.  The <argument> parameters to WINDOW are described
	  in full detail in their own sections.
	  
	  The "current window" is denoted by "^^^^^^^^^^" in the status
	  line for that window. You can switch the current window by
	  activating the key functions PREVIOUS_WINDOW or NEXT_WINDOW.
	  These are bound, by default, to ^Xp and ^Xn, respectively.
	  
	  Each window can have the conversation of a channel going to
	  it, which can be specified by either using WINDOW CHANNEL <c>
	  or by executing the JOIN or CHANNEL commands in a window.
	  Each window can also have its own QUERY user.  When QUERYing
	  someone in a window, all conversation with that person is
	  directed to that window.
	  
	  If you have JOIN or WINDOW CHANNEL commands in a script, like
	  your .ircrc file, you will need to do a WAIT after each JOIN
	  or WINDOW CHANNEL.

xecho
	Usage: XECHO [<flags>] <text>
	  XECHO is like ECHO, except that it takes flag arguments.
	
	Available flags:
	  -LEVEL <level>  displays the message with the specified lastlog
	                  level. This is useful to change the window some
	                  messages are displayed in. This is the only way
	                  to generate a message with the USERLOG1-4 lastlog
	                  levels.
	  -WINDOW <winname> displays the text in the named window, if it can. 
			  If the window doesn't exist, then the -WINDOW flag
	 		  is ignored.

xtra
	See MSG for more information about XTRA.
xtype
	Usage: XTYPE [-LITERAL] <text>
	  XTYPE is like TYPE, except that it takes flag arguments.
	
	Available flags:
	  -LITERAL	Adds text to the input cursor, like /type does,
			but bindings are ignored.
