Usage: KLINE [<time>] <userhost_mask>[,<another>[...]] <reason>
  Adds a K: line to the server config file. If a time is given, the
  kline will last for that given number of minutes. Note that some ircd
  versions do not support the temporary kline feature.

  Multiple klines with the same reason can be sent in succession
  quickly by separating the userhost masks and/or nicknames by commas.
  For example:
    /KLINE nick1,*user@*host2,nick3,nick4,*user@*host5 this is the reason
