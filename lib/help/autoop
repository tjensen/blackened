Usage: AUTOOP [-REMOVE] [<channel> [<userhost_mask>|<nickname>]]
  Adds an entry to the auto-op list. If no mask is given, the auto-op
  list for the given channel will be displayed. If no channel is given,
  all auto-op lists will be displayed.

  Channel * is a special case. Entries in this channel's list will
  be opped in all channels.

  If a nickname is specified rather than a user@host mask, an attempt
  to find that nickname's userhost will be made.  If found, the output
  will be passed through cluster() and added to the auto-op list.

  The -REMOVE flag should is used to remove a userhost, clear
  a channel list, or clear the entire auto-op list.
