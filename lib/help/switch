Usage: SWITCH (<expression>) { (<match>) { <commands> } ... }
  This command works similarly to the C switch statement.  An expression
  is evaluated and matched with one or more possibilities.  When a match
  is found, the immediately following command(s), enclosed in curly
  brackets, is (are) executed.

  Only the first match, if one exists, is executed.  Therefore, the order
  of match expressions may influence the behavior of the SWITCH command.

Example:
  switch ($name)
  {
    (Bob) { echo What's up, Bob? }
    (Frank) { echo Howdy, Frank! }
    (Wendy) { echo Where's the beef? }
    (*) { echo I don't know you! }
  }
