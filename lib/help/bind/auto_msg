Usage: BIND <key> AUTO_MSG
  The AUTO_MSG function clears the input line and types:
    /MSG <nickname>
  The nickname is one which was used previously.

  If the input line already contains text of the above format, any
  message text is saved and appended to the new input line.

  This feature obsoletes the tabkey script.
