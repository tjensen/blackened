Blackened Functions
  Blackened functions are substituted with the format $FUNCTION(arguments).
  A function is an ALIAS which assigns a value to FUNCTION_RETURN.
  For example:
    ALIAS DOUBLE assign FUNCTION_RETURN ${[$0]+[$0]}
  which is the same as:
    ALIAS DOUBLE @ function_return = [$0] * 2
  used with:
    ALIAS SHOWDOUBLE echo $DOUBLE($0)
  will cause
    SHOWDOUBLE 7
  to display "14".

  The following built-in functions already exist and cannot be overriden:

Note:
  The argument separator for most functions is the space character, not the
  comma.
