FSEEK(handle offset whence)
  This function positions the stream associated with handle to the
  specified offset.  The offset is relative to the position
  indicated by whence.

  The whence parameter may be one of the following:
     SEEK_SET	- relative to the start of the file
     SEEK_CUR	- relative to the current position
     SEEK_END	- relative to the end of the file

  If the operation is successful, 0 is returned.  Any other value indicates
  an error.

Examples:
  fseek(1 42 SEEK_SET)
  fseek(1 7 SEEK_CUR)
  fseek(1 -4 SEEK_END)
