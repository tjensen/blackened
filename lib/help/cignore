Usage: CIGNORE [<channel>] [-][<message type>]

  The standard form of CIGNORE allows you to specify which type of
  messages you wish to ignore from a channel.  The message type
  parameter can be one of the following:
    MSGS            All MSGs received
    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
    CTCP            All CTCPs received
    JOINS           Users joining channel
    PARTS           Users leaving channel
    KICKS           Users kicked from channel
    MODES           Channel mode changes
    TOPICS          Channel topic changes
    CRAP            Anything else
    ALL             All of the above message types
    NONE            No message types

  You can specify multiple types of messages to ignore on the
  command line.  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of
  ignoring of that type of message.  For example:
    CIGNORE #Cheese MSGS KICKS
  ignores MSGs and KICKs from #Cheese.  
    CIGNORE #twilight_zone ALL -TOPICS
  ignores all types of messages except TOPICS from #twilight_zone.

  All forms of CIGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
  and the type NONE will remove the channel from the list
  completely.
