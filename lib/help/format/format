Usage: FORMAT [<format name> [<value>]]
  Sets a specified format to a given value.  If FORMAT is used
  with no parameters, all formats and their current settings
  are listed.  If FORMAT is used with a format name and no
  value, that formats current setting is listed.

  Format items are identified by the percent (%) sign.  The
  character following the percent sign specifies the item to
  show.  The following characters are valid for all format
  types:
    
    @        Timestamp
    !        Highlight
    B        Banner (usually "*** ")
    U        Userhost
    *        Cluster(Userhost)

  In some situations, certain format characters have no effect.  For
  example, a "%U" in NOTIFY_SIGNON will be replaced by a blank, since
  no userhost is associated with that format.
