Usage: FE (<list>) <variables> { <commands> }
  This causes <commands> to be executed once for each 
  word in the list.  The aliases inside the {} 
  are not expanded until execution unless the leading { 
  is quoted like \{

  Here are a couple examples of basic fe commands.
    fe (how now brown cow) ii { echo $ii }
  will return
    how
    now
    brown
    cow

  FE can also be imbedded such as in the following example.
    alias showwords {
      fe (how now) ii
      {
        fe (brown cow) jj
        {
	  echo $ii $jj
        }
      }
    }
  And /showwords returns.. 
    how brown
    how cow
    now brown   
    now cow

  Multiple variables can be listed as follows:
    alias showtwo {
      fe (how now brown cow) ii jj {
        echo $ii $jj
      }
    }
  which returns:
    how now
    brown cow

  Notice that variable names 'ii' and 'jj' were used.  Any name can
  be used for the index but keep in mind that single letter vars can
  interfere with the built in single char vars.  See ALIAS special
