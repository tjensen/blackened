Usage: QUEUE [<switch>] [ [<name>] [ ... ] ]
  This command manages queues for future batch processing.

  If no switches are provided, the command adds an item to a queue.
  Note that the item must be enclosed in { } brackets to be added.
  For example:

    /QUEUE qname { echo This is an item in a queue. }

  To run the contents of a queue, use the -DO switch with the name
  of the queue.  Note that the named queue will be removed after it
  is run.

    /QUEUE -DO qname

  To run the contents of a queue without removing it afterwards, use
  the -NO_FLUSH switch:

    /QUEUE -NO_FLUSH qname

  To view the contents of a queue, use the -LIST switch with the
  name of the queue:

    /QUEUE -LIST qname

  To view all queues, use the -SHOW switch:

    /QUEUE -SHOW

  To remove an item from a queue, use the -DELETE switch with the
  the name of the queue and the item number:

    /QUEUE -DELETE qname 1

  To completely remove an entire queue, use the -FLUSH switch with
  the name of the queue:

    /QUEUE -FLUSH qname
