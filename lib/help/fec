Usage: FEC (<list>) <variable> { <commands> }
  This causes <commands> to be executed once for each 
  character in the list.  The aliases inside the {} 
  are not expanded until execution unless the leading { 
  is quoted like \{
  Here are a couple examples of basic foreach commands.
    fec (blue) ii { echo $ii }
  will return
    b
    l
    u
    e
  FEC can also be imbedded such as in the following example.
    alias showchars {
      fec (AB) ii
      {
        fec (cd) jj
        {
	  echo $ii $jj
        }
      }
    }
  And /showchars returns.. 
    A c
    A d
    B c
    B d

  Notice that variable names 'ii' and 'jj' were used.  Any name can
  be used for the index but keep in mind that single letter vars can
  interfere with the built in single char vars.  See ALIAS special
