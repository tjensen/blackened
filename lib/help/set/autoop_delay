Usage: SET AUTOOP_DELAY <seconds>
  This variable tells the AutoOp system how long to wait before auto-
  matically giving someone ops.  The actual delay is a random value
  between AUTOOP_DELAY and two times AUTOOP_DELAY.

  The use of AUTOOP_DELAY is highly recommended, as it can help
  prevent floods of mode changes in large channels.

  If AUTOOP_DELAY is zero, the user is given ops immediately after
  joining.
