Usage: SET URLLOG_LEVEL [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
  The setting of this variable determines which types of messages
  are written to the URL log.  If ALL is specified, all lines
  containing URLs that show up on the screen are saved to the URL
  log, except DCC mesages, which have to be explicitly set.
  eg, to get everything, use

    /SET URLLOG_LEVEL DCC,ALL

  If NONE is specified, nothing is saved in the URL log.  The <level>
  specification can be one of the following: 
    PUBLIC          Channel conversation
    MSGS            Private messages
    NOTICES         NOTICEs
    WALLS           WALLs
    WALLOPS         WALLOPs
    NOTE            NOTEs
    OPNOTES         Operator notifications
    SNOTES          Server notices
    ACTIONS         In and outgoing CTCP ACTION lines
    USERLOG1        Reserved for the user
    USERLOG2        Reserved for the user
    USERLOG3        Reserved for the user
    USERLOG4        Reserved for the user
    DCC             DCC connections
    BEEP            Beeps
    CRAP            Anything not covered by the above categories

  You can combine these on a command line to make the URL log
  save just what you want.  Also, by putting a - before any
  level, you remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
  wish to save everything except NOTEs and all that CRAP, you
  could do:
    SET URLLOG_LEVEL ALL -NOTE -CRAP
  which is the same as doing:
    SET URLLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL WALLOP OPNOTES ACTIONS SNOTES

  In order to be recognized, URLs must begin with "http://".
