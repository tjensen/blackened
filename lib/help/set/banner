Usage: SET BANNER <some text>
  Sets the banner string to be displayed to the left of most messages
  from the client or server.  For example, in the following line:

    *** There are no nicknames being ignored

  The text, "*** ", is the banner.

  NOTE: In server numeric messages, if SHOW_NUMERICS is ON, this
	variable's text will not be displayed.  Instead, the 3-digit
	server numeric will be shown as the banner.
