Usage: SET OPS_METHOD [DEFAULT|WALLCHOPS|HYBRID|AUTO]
  Determines how the OPS and WALL commands send messages to all
  channel operators.

  When set to DEFAULT, the commands use the old-style method of sending
  messages to multiple targets.  Use SET MAX_WALL_NICKS to tune the
  maximum number of nicknames to message at one time.

  When set to WALLCHOPS, the client will use the server WALLCHOPS
  command.  Some servers may not support this method, however recent
  versions of the Undernet ircd do.

  When set to HYBRID, the client will use the method of sending a
  message to @#channel.  Some servers may not support this method, however
  Hybrid versions 6 and higher do.

  When set to AUTO, the client will attempt to determine which method
  is supported by the server you are connected to by looking at the server
  version.
