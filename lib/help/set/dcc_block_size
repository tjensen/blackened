Usage: SET DCC_BLOCK_SIZE <size in bytes>
  Controls the size of blocks sent when sending files 
  using DCC SEND.

  The default is normally 512. Increasing this number
  increases network efficiency. Decreasing this number
  slows down the transfer, but also decreases the chances
  of the transfer being aborted over bad links.
