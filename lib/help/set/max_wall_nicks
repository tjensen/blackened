Usage: SET MAX_WALL_NICKS <maximum number of nicks to wall>
  This will limit the number of nicks that will be sent messages at the
  same time when using the WALL or OPS command.  The server may
  prohibit you from using large values, but small values can cause you
  to flood yourself off the server when used in large channels.

  This variable has no effect when OPS_METHOD is HYBRID.
