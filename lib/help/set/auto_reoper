Usage: SET AUTO_REOPER [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Determines whether to make the client automatically regain server
  operator status after reconnecting to a server.

  WARNING: When this variable is ON, your plaintext server operator
  password is stored in memory and might be readable by other processes
  with sufficient privileges.  Not recommended for use on untrusted
  systems.  Use at your own risk!

  To wipe your operator password for the currently connected server, use
  the DEOPER command.  To wipe all operator passwords, set this
  variable to OFF.  Wiping operator passwords involves writing null
  characters over the buffer, followed by writing the inverse, then all
  nulls again.  Finally, the buffer is deallocated from memory.
