		     INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION FOR IRCII

Notes: In this version it is important to install the `translation' and
      `script' directory.  See the IRCII_LIBRARY variable in the
      config.h

You might be tempted to try the 'install' script here by
issuing the command      csh install     and then answer the
questions.  At the point where it asks if you want to compile you
can say 'no' and go on to step 1, or you can say 'yes' and try to
compile the client.  Note that install1.0 assumes you are on a
bsd, ultrix, or sun type machine.  Most other machines require
manual changes to the Makefile in order to compile.

 o  Using your favorite editor, modify the config.h file to meet
    your site specifications.  Instructions for doing this are
    included in the config.h file.  

 o  Again using your favorite editor, modify the Makefile to meet
    your site specifications regarding program and help file
    installation, etc.  Instructions are included in the Makefile.

 o  Type "make install".  This will compile and install the program.
    Then type "make installscript" and "make installtranslation" to
    install the scripts and the character translation tables to
    their definitive locations.

 o  If you wish to install the ircserv program as well,
    type "make installserv".

 o  If you wish to install the ircflush program as well,
    type "make installflush".
    See the Makefile about using ircserv and ircflush.

 o  If you wish to have ircII interact with screen and/or xterm to
    have multiple screen, type "make installwserv".

 o  You can do `make installeverything' to do all of the above steps
    at the same time

 o  If your ircII client behaves in a way you didn't want it to, it
    might be related to the things it executes at startup, precisely
    the script/global file, and the related script/local.
    For information about the scripts read also the /HELP LOAD.

 o  If you are running Solaris 2, you will probably need to have
    environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to /usr/ucblib, or
    to compile statically (with -static)

 o  BigCheese is no longer on Internet (since June, 1991) and Troy
    no longer maintains ircII (since September 1992), so you should
    now redirect questions and comments to
	Matthew Green <phone@coombs.anu.edu.au>..  phone on IRC
    or to the ircII coders mailing list
	ircii-coders@cbme.unsw.edu.au
    or to the alt.irc or alt.irc.ircii newsgroups.
