This version of IRCII supports the use of privileged ports. A modified
server which only accepts connections from clients whose port number is
below 1024 can use this to ensure the integrity of the user name field
from the user@host pair.

The procedure for installing IRCII for privileged ports is slightly
different. First, you should uncomment the PP_OBJS and PP_DEFS macros
in Makefile. Then touch config.h and make. The value for PRIV_PORT
specified in PP_DEFS is the lower bound port IRCII should try to use.
In practice this value is unlikely to matter, provided it is below 1000.

If your system has the saved UID feature, you can use a more secure
version of the privileged port code. See test-suid.c and Makefile for
details on this.

Once you have made IRCII, and installed it, you will need to do one of
two things:

	1) If you are using ircserv, make the ircserv program owned by
	   root, with a secure group ID. For example, you could create
	   the group ID irc, and have ircserv's group be irc.

	   Change the mode of ircserv so that nobody other than a member
	   of that group (or root) can execute it. Then make irc setgid
	   to that group.

	   eg:  chown root.irc ircserv
		chmod 4710 ircserv
		chgrp irc irc
		chmod 2711 irc

	   If there is a chance that users may be unable to execute the
	   ircserv process due to processes being exhausted, you can make
	   irc setuid->root too.

	2) If you are not using ircserv, you will need to install irc
	   setuid->root.

	   eg:  chown root irc
		chmod 4711 irc

Note: The Implementation with the ircserv process can be proven to be
	secure trivially. This is not the case with the non ircserv
	version, although the potential waeknesses have been carefully
	analysed, and to the best of my knowledge, none exist.
