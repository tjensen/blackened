.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a full screen, termcap based interface to Internet Relay Chat.
Based on ircII-2.8.2, it gives full access to all of the normal
.Tn IRC
functions, plus a wide variety of additional options, including many 
that are highly useful to
.Tn IRC
server operators and administrators.
.Ss "The Screen"
The screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video
status line
.Pq "if supported" .
The upper
.Pq larger
part of the screen displays responses from the
.Tn IRC
server.
The lower part of the screen
.Pq a single line
accepts keyboard input.
.Pp
Some terminals do not support certain features required by
.Nm Blackened ,
in which case you receive a message stating this.
If this occurs, try changing the terminal type or run
.Nm
with the
.Fl d
option.
.Ss "Irc Commands"
Any line beginning with the slash character
.Sq /
is regarded as a
.Nm
command
.Po the command character may be changed; type
.Dq Ic "/help set cmdchar"
.Pc .
Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to
be sent to the current channel.
To produce a listing of commands, type
.Dq "/help ?" .
To receive information about the commands type
.Do Ic /help\ 
.Aq Ic command
.Dc .
.Ss "The .ircrc File"
When
.Nm
is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a
.Pa \&.ircrc
file, executing the commands in the file. Commands in this file do not
need to have a leading slash character
.Sq / .
This allows predefinition of aliases and other features.
.Ss "The Help Files"
All of the
.Nm
commands are fully described in the help files package.  The best way to
start help is with the
.Dq Ic /HELP\ ?
command as this prints a listing of all available help files.
