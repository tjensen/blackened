This file documents the changes since ircII 2.2.9.


New functions:

  o  onchannel(nick #channel)   is `nick' on `#channel' ?
  o  pid()                      returns the pid of this client
  o  ppid()                     returns the parent pid of this client
  o  chanusers(#channel)        returns a list of the users on this channel
  o  for()                      like c's for with the separator being `,' not
                                `;'.  (hop)
  o  fe() and fec()             an alternative to recursion.  (hop)

New commands:

  o  beep                       sends a beep to the terminal
  o  rbind function             shows the keys bound to `function'
  o  stack action list arg      `action' is either push or pop. list is one
                                of `on', `alias', `assign', `bind', or `set'.
                                only `on' is implemented currently
  o  window remove nick         the opposite of window add.
  o  window number num          changes the refnum of a window, forcing a
                                swap if so needed.
  o  window bind #chan          permanently bind a channel to a window.
  o  window unbind [#chan]      remove permanent binding to a window.
  o  abort                      drops a core file, and a saved file (hop).
  o  disconnect [ser [reason]]  disconnects from the named server (number) with
                                the given reason.

Fixed commands:

  o  set help_window            now works again.
  o  dcc close send nick file   no longer requires the full path for `file'.
  o  transpose_characters       now works with the cursor at the `end' of the
                                screen.
  o  topic *                    now works as expected.

Changed commands:

  o  userhost [nicks] -cmd      now accepts any number of nicks.
  o  save [-all] [...]          save `all' values, or any part.  valid parts
                                are: assign, alias, all, bind, notify, on,
                                set and digraph.

  o  clear -unhold              as well as clearing the screen, it also
                                unholds one screen.  same as the binding
                                clear_screen

New scripts:

  o  newaway                    does `set show_away_once on' in scripts and
                                with as many nicks as you want
  o  uhnotify                   gives userhost with the notify list.  works
                                much better with the new userhost syntax.
  o  complete, compl.mods       tcsh-like complete scripts.  see script for
                                more information.
  o  imap                       creates an irc map.  see script for more info.
  o  undernet			script to make ircII understand undernet extras.

Changed scripts:

  o  2.8script
  o  finger
  o  newformat
  o  netsplit

New variables:

  o  realname                   changes the value of your `realname' the
                                next time you change servers (or use 
                                `/quote quit').
  o  notify_handler             three values.  `noisy', `quiet', and `old'
                                old makes /notify work like it did for 2.2,
                                `noisy'  and `quiet' make it work on a lot
                                more events.  join/quit/message/etc trigger
                                the notify, the difference being that `quiet'
                                won't show these extra differences, where as
                                `noisy' will.  they both add/remove the
                                name to the internal `notified' list.
  o  screen_options             this is orthogonal to xterm_options for
                                /window create.

Other things:

  o  redirect works much better.  it doesn't `catch' things it shouldn't in
     most cases.
  o  lots and lots and logs of bug fixes
  o  ctcp flooding is handled better.
  o  lots and lots of bug fixes.
  o  on dcc_raw dcc close works.
  o  all dcc messages go to level dcc
  o  level all contains `dcc' again.
  o  lots of bug fixes.
  o  gnu `autoconf'ified.
  o  did i meantion lots of bug fixes?
  o  if you add #define DYNAMIC_SLIP, you don't need to restart ircii
     for it to notice the ip number of the local machine has changed.
     --- this has been obsoleted by a smarter, more general method.
  o  /window create might be stabler.  really this time.
  o  new `-q' switch does `quick start' (no .ircrc processing)
  o  /window server support is much much better now.
