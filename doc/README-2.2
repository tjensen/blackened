If you're feeling adventurous you might give the 'install' script a
shot with the command 

csh install

(it doesn't do anything bad it just doesn't try to figure out your
machine type)
It'll ask you some questions about the really basic stuff that needs
to be taken care of to compile the client.  Then when it asks if you
want to compile, you can say no and go modify the config.h or Makefile
to your tastes or say 'yes' and let it compile.  You can even let it 
try to install stuff but install isn't accessible on all machines.
What can I say, it works for me.
