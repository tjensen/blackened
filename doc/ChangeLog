		didn't have hook code for it.
	source/input.c:
		Fixed lame bug in write a character to the screen.

Mon Mar 22 02:24:43 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

		level ..

	config.h, config.h.lynx:
		Added two new variables, XTERM_OPTIONS, whose value is

		Fixed the INFO and MOTD numerics so that they will work
		with the new ones from ircd 2.8-7+ .. blah ..
	source/newio.c:
		new_select() - fixed so that select() wouldn't over right
		the struct timeval...
		

Fri Mar 12 18:27:31 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/edit.c:
		send_com() - wasn't prefixing the arguements with a
		: which meant ircd 2.8 was being lame ...  For some
		commands, using send_comm()

Mon Mar  8 10:22:03 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/exec.c:

	source/edit.c, source/irc.c
		Finally did The Right Thing (tm) with the wait key junk
		that help uses, and moved it from irc_io() to edit_char()
		where I should have put it originally.  Also fixes a bug
		in dumb mode.

Thu Feb 18 01:48:05 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

		Fixed away bugs..
	source/window.c:
		update_all_status() - doesn't call traverse_all_windows()

	source/
		Support for 386BSD added (Mycroft)

Sun Feb  7 05:04:23 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/alias.c:
		alias_currdir(), and `$W' now return the current working

		(poxaV).

		alias_current_numeric(), and `$H' now return the current
		numeric.

		New variable NO_CTCP_FLOOD, which when set makes ircii
		only send one CTCP reply per second.
	source/numbers.c, source/whois.c, source/names.c, source/funny.c:
		Changed all the numerics replies so that $0 is now the
		server name (if it want't already), except for ISON and
		USERHOST, as these are server local anyway.

Tue Feb  2 21:40:46 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/edit.c, source/whois.c:
		Removed /msg -channel as it doesn't make sense anymore.

Wed Jan 27 22:48:46 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c, source/irc.c:
		Changed create_additional_screen() to select on the listening
		socket, and timeout after 5 seconds, returning an error, 
		rather than just calling accept().  This stops the case where
		the wserv process doesn't get started, and the client will
		hang in the accept().  Removed the force arguement from
		kill_screen(), and all the calls to it.

	source/edit.c:
		renamed new_send_line() to sendlinecmd() so that it follows
		the general ircII pattern (is there such a thing ? - phone :)
		
Tue Jan 26 19:03:51 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/irc.c, source/ircaux.c, source/notice.c, source/scandir.c,
	source/term.c, source/ircflush.c:
		added support for Linux

Mon Jan 25 02:52:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/dcc.c, source/exec.c, source/server.c, source/window.c:
		added close_all_dcc(), close_all_exec() and close_all_server(),
		which are called from create_additional_screen(), from the
		forked process to close all unneeded file descriptors.
		create_screen() - fixed bug when create_screen() returns a
		screen that was marked as being !alive.
		Hmm, somewhere here I think I have fixed the bug with the
		position of the cursor, when using more than one screen.
		No idea if it is fixed, but I can't get it to happen.
	source/names.c:
		set_window_channel() - fixed bug when channel was NULL.

Thu Jan 21 18:16:16 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c, source/dcc.c:
		Added flag to dcc_message_transmit(), to indicate if the

		to a dcc chat connection, which is now possible.

Wed Jan 20 23:41:50 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c, source/edit.c, source/whois.c, source/window.h:
		Changed how REDIRECT works.  We now send a redirect token
		to the server when redirecting, not a wait token.  It is in
		the form of #RED#nnnn where nnnn is the screen's number
		(internal).  Redirect also is a property of the screen, not
		of the whole of ircII.  This means that there are no more
		valid reasons to call irc_io() recursively.
	source/mysetjmp.h, source/mysetjmp.c, source/irc.c, source/alias.c,
	source/window.c, source/window.h:
		Removed all the code that was applicable to the mysetjmp()
		code, as there are no need for it anymore - only /WAIT and
		$".." call irc_io() recursively, and they can be used in
		other (better) ways.

Tue Jan 19 14:05:52 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/help.c:
		You guessed it.. another bug.. fixed.
	source/window.c;
		window() - fixed bugs in WINDOW SERVER.
	source/parse.c, source/edit.c, source/exec.c:
		Added doing_privmsg, which makes ircII convert all attempts
		to PRIVMSG from a PRIVMSG in to a NOTICE.
	source/parse.c, source/whois.c:
		Added flag to HOST and USERHOST commands.  It allows a command
		to be executed when the the userhost (302) reply comes back
		from the server - userhost_cmd_returned().
	source/edit.c;
		Added new command INPUT.  Takes a ".." prompt as its first
		parameter, and displays this, and prompts for input that
		expanded, and passed to the command that is its second arg.
		(ie, /INPUT "prompt> " echo $*).  This should be used as
		a replacement for $".." type variables.

Sun Jan 17 22:01:34 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/help.c:
		help_prompt() - fixed another bug..  when will it end..?
	source/dcc.c:
		register_dcc_offer() - made dcc collisions for DCC CHAT
		automatically connect to the other party.  Impressed.
	source/window.h, source/window.c:
		Added new define in winodw.h SCROLL_AFTER_DISPLAY .. which
		makes the display scroll like it used to in 2.1.5.

Sun Jan 17 01:16:37 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Fixed lame bug in funny_list() which caused the wide list
		to be corrupted when more than 50 in it.

Sat Jan 16 17:42:41 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c:

		now.

		help_me() - fixed a stupid bug that would cause help to
		become trapped, and unusable for that session.

Fri Jan 15 16:26:13 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/irc.c, source/window.c:
		Finally got irc_io() knowing when a socket connection to
		a wserv process closes, and to kill that screen, I know
		don't know of any pending bugs directly related to
		WINDOW CREATE.

	source/irc.c, source/help.c:
		Got help working properly again (I think), and all the
		checking to make sure ircII won't get confused, etc.

Fri Jan 15 03:07:48 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/help.c:
		Added variable help_screen, that is set when we enter a
		help command, and is set to NULL when we exit.  In help(),
		I made it illegal to call help from more then one screen
		at the same time.
	source/irc.c, source/window.c:
		Added new function is_main_screen(), and added code to 
		irc_io() to detect if a screen is closed from something
		other than window delete.

	Makefile, source/Makefile.proto:
		Removed the INSTALL section of this, replacing it with a
		cp, strip, and chmod, as not all machines support install.
		Also added new target `everything' to the Makefile.. that
		does the same as `make all ircflush ircserv wserv'.

Wed Jan 13 18:19:26 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/alias.c, source/edit.c:
		Smallish revamp of the whole modules, formatting for 80 columns
		and smallish optimizations here and there.  Could be bugs here
		I guess.
	source/crypt.c, source/ctcp.c, source/dcc.c, source/exec.c,
	source/flood.c, source/funny.c, source/help.c, source/history.c,
	source/hold.c, source/hook.c, source/if.c, source/ignore.c,
	source/input.c, source/irc.c, source/ircaux.c, source/ircflush.c,
	source/ircserv.c, source/key.c, source/lastlog.c, source/list.c,
	source/log.c, source/mail.c, source/menu.c, source/mysetjmp.c
	source/names.c, source/newio.c, source/notice.c, source/notify.c
	source/numbers.c, source/output.c, source/parse.c source/reg.c,
	source/status.c, source/server.c, source/term.c source/translat.c,
	source/vars.c, source/whois.c, source/window.c, source/wserv.c:
		reformatted for 80 columns, hopefully thats the end of the
		formatting saga..  :)

Tue Jan 12 16:42:55 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/dcc.c:
		Changed the call to put_it() for ultrix machines so that
		the floating pointers won't get garbled.
	source/ctcp.c, source/ctcp.h:
		Fixed send_ctcp_reply(), and removed Transmit_CTCP() moving
		the 2 lines to the only place it was called from.
	source/translat.c, source/term.c, source/ignore.c:
		reformatted.

Mon Jan 11 16:40:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c:
		Changed window() so that the handling of HOLD_MODE called
		set_int_var() rather than reset_line_cnt().  Fixed a problem
		with /flush.

Mon Jan 11 01:35:22 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/lastlog.c, source/file.c, source/crypt.c, source/list.c:
		reformatted.

Mon Jan 11 00:29:41 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/names.h, source/names.c, source/window.c, source/window.h,
	source/edit.c, source/parse.c:
		Changed the handing of WINDOW CHANNEL, and JOIN so that
		ircII now remembers what window a channel was joined on.
		channel() in both parse.c and edit.c were changed, 
		add_channel() in names.c.  New function, set_channel_window()
		added, in names.c thats sets a channel's window, and as such,
		Window * added to ChannelList.  This sometimes helps ircII
		remember what channels were on which windows, when
		re-connecting to a server.  Sometimes.

	source/ctcp.c, source/output.c, source/hook.h.proto, source/parse.c,
	source/output.h:
		Moved the ctcp_* functions in output.c to ctcp.c, where they
		belong, and also put in_on_who in hook.h.proto, and fixed
		those fucntions that used it.

Sun Jan 10 10:30:20 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Changed funny_list(), fixing the -TOPIC argument to the
		LIST command.  Changed the functionality of -TOPIC so
		that it works *with* the other arguements, not against
		them.

Sun Jan 10 09:23:43 EST 1993 - poxaV <cgw@unt.edu>

	source/vars.h.proto, source/vars.c, source/status.c, config.h:
		renamed status_user() to status_user0(), and added 3
		new functions, status_user[123]()..  New variables
		STATUS_USER[0-3] ..  to go with the new status line
		functions, %X, %Y and %Z.

Thu Jan  7 00:13:14 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/status.c:
		Fixed status_oper() so that it wouldn't show
		if SHOW_STATUS_ALL wasn't set.

Wed Jan  6 19:04:42 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/funny.c:
		Changed funny_print_widelist() ..  it now works
		again, I don't know when I broke it.

Wed Jan  6 11:59:11 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/term.c, source/wserv.c:
		Made the term_init() call used in wserv to set the
		line discipline to RAW, so I could forget about
		having to worry about signals, and removed the
		SIGINT handling from wserv.c.  Hopefully this means
		that wserv works properly now.  (thanks to Dizzy
		<nathan@eas.gatech.edu> for help with this).

Wed Jan  6 00:03:00 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/Makefile.proto:
		updated depandancies, and re-organised the
		SOURCES and OBJECTS.

	source/timer.c, source/edit.c, source/irc.c, source/irc.h,
	source/mysetjmp.c, source/mysetjmp.h, source/window.c:
		Moved everything from timer.c into either edit.c
		or irc.c.  Made WINDOW_CREATE define more parts
		out, in irc.c, mysetjmp.[ch], and window.c.

Tue Jan  5 20:59:36 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/exec.c:
		Reformatted, and new element of the process list
		added, server, to allow /exec -out/msg/notice
		to go to the right server.

	source/newio.c:
		reformatted.

Tue Jan  5 18:06:25 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/edit.c, source/keys.c:
		Added new function parsekeycmd(), and new command,
		PARSEKEY which calls it - does the same as typing
		a key which is bound the the arguement.

Tue Jan  5 17:03:04 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/window.c:
		Changed window() so that the WINDOW CHANNEL
		command with no arguments make the current
		window's channel null.

Tue Jan  5 16:15:51 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/wserv.c:
		Changed got_sigint() to send the ^C down the pipe,
		rather than kill SIGINT the ircII process, as this
		was causing the ^C to be read as though it was from
		the main screen.

Tue Jan  5 01:57:58 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/edit.c:
		Changed new_send_line() to set the display on.

Mon Jan  4 23:46:58 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	source/vars.h.proto, source/vars.c, source/hook.c, source/edit.c,
	config.h:
		New variable INPUT_PROTECTION.  Doesn't allow any
		ON INPUT's to be added when set.  ON INPUT moved to
		send_line(), so that all input is caught in the hook,
		SENDLINE command added, that calls the new function,
		new_send_line, that does a simliar thing to the send_line
		command, except, no handling for prompts, or ON INPUT is
		done during this.

Mon Jan  4 15:23:34 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	hook.c:
		reformatted.

Fri Jan  1 23:46:03 EST 1993 - Matthew Green <mrg@mame.mu.oz.au>

	*.h:
		Fixed all the header files, so that if included more than
		once, they are only parsed once.
