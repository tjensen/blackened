NOTE: This is the INSTALL doc from the original ircii-2.8.2 client.
      Pretty much everything applies to Blackened as well, so I
      haven't changed anything.

to compile ircii

  o  there are 2 main ways of configuring ircii for your system.  you
     can either run the `easyinst' script, or, if you know how to use
     gnu configure scripts, you can use that directly, and then edit
     include/config.h yourself.

  o  using easyinst:
      - in the same directory that this file is in, type `./easyinst'.
	if you are using an old version of system v, you might need
	`sh easyinst'.
      - this script asks you a few questions and then calls configure
        for you.
      - you will then need to run `make' and `make install'.

  o  using configure directly:
      - in the same directory that this file is in, type `./configure'.
	if you are using an old version of system v, you might need
	`sh configure'.

      - this script tries to guess various things about your system
        that are important to it compiling.  it creates various files
        in this process.  configure takes a couple of minutes to run.

     WARNING: gnu sed vesrion 2.05 (and maybe 2.04 -- i don't know)
     will not function properly with this configure script.  gnu
     sed version 2.03 does.  please do not send me a bug report if
     you are using gnu sed version 2.05 (such as linux systems)

      - when this has finished, you might want to check the Makefile
        for the places ircii will be installed.  the defaults are
        /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man.  you can
        either do `make prefix=/local' or set it with configure, by
        calling configure with the `--prefix=/local' switch.

  o  compiling ircii - type `make' in the main ircii directory.  this
     will compile the `irc', `ircflush', `ircserv', and `wserv'
     programs that reside in the source sub directory.

  o  once the programs are compiled, you can install them with
     `make install'.  this will install all the binaries, scripts,
     translation tables, and the ircii man page.

  o  you can now delete the object files and binaries from the source
     directory with `make clean'.  `make distclean' will also delete
     any file that `configure' created.  this is useful for then
     using the same sources to compile on a different architecture.


notes on portability.

  o  there is a bug in the compiler shipped with bsdi's operating
     sytem that causes ircii to fail to compile.  if you use the
     `gcc2' compiler rather than `gcc' or `cc' this problem is
     alleviated.  complain to bsdi about their broken compiler.
     the configure process also seems to fail to add `-ll' to the
     LEXLIB variable in the Makefile.

  o  some exotic mips machines are not yet accounted for in the
     configuration process, and must have certain things set
     specially in the Makefile (these are noted in the Makefile
     itself).

  o  there are problems with the configure script running under qnx.
     in the file qnx.patch exist patches for the defs.h.in and
     Makefile files that may need to be applied.  there is also an
     experimental patch to irc.c that qnx needs, but has not been
     tested on other operating systems yet that needs to be applied.
     these can be applied by running `patch -p0 < qnx.pach' in the
     ircii directory.

  o  some versions of nextstep (3.x?) require some serious kludges
     to get ircii to compile and work.  if you have problems with
     missing __environ, __NXArgc, etc, run the make command again
     with "make CFLAGS=-O" (or `-g\ -O' if you want debugging as
     well) for the final link, and see if that works.  if not, you'll
     have to hack around with various flags, or the LIBS variable
     in the Makefile.
